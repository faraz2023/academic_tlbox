Owing to the skewed distribution of public datasets, software defect prediction (SDP) suffers from the class imbalance problem, which leads to unsatisfactory results. Overfitting is also one of the biggest challenges for SDP. In this study, the authors performed an empirical study of these two problems and investigated their probable solution. They have conducted 4840 experiments over five different classifiers using eight NASA projects and 14 PROMISE repository datasets. They suggested and investigated the varying kernel function of an extreme learning machine (ELM) along with kernel principal component analysis (K-PCA) and found better results compared with other classical SDP models. They used the synthetic minority oversampling technique as a sampling method to address class imbalance problems and k-fold cross-validation to avoid the overfitting problem. They found ELM-based SDP has a high receiver operating characteristic curve over 11 out of 22 datasets. The proposed model has higher precision and F-score values over ten and nine, respectively, compared with other state-of-the-art models. The Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 17 datasets of the proposed model surpasses other classical models' MCC. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.",,"John Wiley and Sons Inc"

While machine learning algorithms have been widely used for network intrusion detection, most standard techniques cannot achieve consistent good performance across multiple classes. In this paper we proposed a novel ensemble system based on the modified adaptive boosting with area under the curve (M-AdaBoost-A) algorithm to detect network intrusions more effectively. We combined multiple M-AdaBoost-A-based classifiers into an ensemble by employing various strategies, including particle swarm optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to utilize the M-AdaBoost-A algorithm, which incorporates the area under the curve into the boosting process for addressing class imbalance in network intrusion detection. Compared with existing standard techniques, our proposed ensemble system achieved superior performance across multiple classes in both 802.11 wireless intrusion detection and traditional enterprise intrusion detection. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Boosting; Class imbalance; Ensemble learning; Machine learning; Network intrusion detection; Particle swarm optimization","Elsevier Ltd"

This strategy can unnecessarily complicate the model selection and evaluation in imbalance datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new metric, imbalance accuracy metric (IAM), that can be used as a solo measure for model evaluation and selection. The IAM is built up on top of the existing metrics, is simple to use, and easy to interpret.

However, it is really a challenging task to extract meaningful features from a burst of raw tweets as emotions are subjective with limited fuzzy boundaries. These subjective features can be expressed in different terminologies and perceptions. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid approach of LDA and machine learning to predict emotions for large scale of imbalanced tweets. First, the raw tweets are preprocessed using tokenization method for capturing useful features without noisy information. Second, the local and global feature's importance is estimated by applying TFIDF statistical technique. Third, the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling method is used to extract topics from these features. These topics explain concepts of related tweet which is really helpful for classification. Fourth, the Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) class balancing technique is applied to oversample the data and balance each class of topic. Finally, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) machine learning algorithm is applied to predict the emotions in extracted topics. The class balancing method increase the significance of minor classes and solve the problem of class imbalance. The proposed approach is evaluated on two different Twitters' emotions datasets. It is proved that, this methodology outperformed as compared to the popular state of the art methods in terms of precision, recall, f-measure and classification accuracy. © 2020 ACM.",,"Association for Computing Machinery"

In addition to the class imbalance, there is another imbalance of regional samples in the feature space. In order to reduce the impact of class imbalance and regional imbalance on the performance of the model, a method of dual cost-sensitivity factors for transient stability assessment is proposed. The method sets the balance factor and modulating factor in the loss function of light gradient boosting machine. The former corrects the classification bias caused by class imbalance, and the latter focuses on improving the classification accuracy of overlapping area samples. Combining the two factors, the model not only improves the accuracy of unstable samples, but also reduces the misjudgement of stable samples.

These problems result in model overfitting, poor accuracy, and poor generalization. Traditional augmentation techniques, and advanced augmentation, such as adversarial approaches, have individually been found to be effective. In this work, we present a method to determine the most effective augmentation techniques to combine into the machine learning pipeline. We propose using only two augmentations in the pipeline, an advanced technique applied in an offline manner followed by a simple technique applied in an online manner. This approach is validated by application to two medical image problems using datasets characterized by class imbalances and small sizes. The former is a binary classification problem using a brain tumor dataset and the latter is a multi-label classification problem using a white blood cell dataset. Exhaustive experimentation with approximately 170 different combinations of augmentations methods is reported. Experimental results indicate a 15% and 11% improvement in validation accuracy over using no augmentation and a 2% improvement over using a single augmentation.

When it is discovered, it is already an advanced stage with a low cure rate. Therefore, it is of great significance to improve the diagnostic ability of early screening for ovarian cancer. In this study, we feature engineered CA125 by calculating the rate of change of CA125 in addition to selecting a few top-ranked important features from PLCO ovarian cancer dataset. The dataset was extremely imbalanced; the imbalance ratio (ratio of negative samples in the majority class to positive examples in the minority class) was 143.7. Twenty-three types of class-imbalanced learning methods were used in this study to improve the predictive ability of the model. We identified the decision tree method with the highest AUC value among nine classic classifiers (decision tree, AdaBoost, etc.) to build a model with the class imbalance method, and showed their comparison. We identified the decision tree using SVMSMOTE has the most robust predictive ability for ovarian cancer, with a PPV of 0.9041, AUC of 0.9532, the sensitivity of 0.7792, and specificity of 0.9982. The high PPV shown by the model selected in this study indicates that the true positive samples predicted by the model account for 90.41%. Compared with other studies, the PPV of this study increased by 81.3%.

Energy theft is tampering with smart meter reading to reduce customer energy usage and reduce electricity bills. A thief customer tends to consume more energy and hence, the theft negatively affects the power supply quality in the form of transformer overload, voltage unbalance, and voltage drop on system buses. Meanwhile, it also causes great economic losses for the business of electric utility. In order to enable efficient energy theft detection, data-driven approaches including utilizing trained deep neural networks are proposed in this paper. The machine learning approaches can detect energy theft involving stealthy connections or meter tampering at the level of smart meters or aggregated levels.

Through efficient fraud detection using a robust approach, the banking industry will be able to avert fraudulent transactions and save millions of dollars every year. Each money transaction is crucial and thus, fraudulent transactions need to be detected at any cost. In this paper, we build models to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using five classifiers to find out the best fit classifier for the situation. We use two different techniques to tackle the inherent problem of data imbalance. The first technique uses data resampling technique to increase the number of samples in the minority class, whereas, the second one uses a cost-based approach where the error function incorporates weights of each class. Through the weights, more emphasis can be given to the samples of fraudulent transactions than the normal samples. © 2020 IEEE.","credit card fraud detection; data mining; machine learning; neural networks","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The k-nearest neighbors (KNN) is one of the most known approaches for predicting diabetes. Many researchers have found by combining KNN with one or more other algorithms may provide a better result. In this paper, a combination of three procedures, removing noise, reducing the dimension, and weighting distance, is proposed to improve a standard voting-based KNN to classify Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset (PIDD) into two classes. First, the noises in the training set are removed using k-means clustering (KMC) to make the voter data in both classes more competent. Second, its dimensional is then reduced to decrease the intra-class data distances but increase the inter-class ones. Two methods of dimensional reduction: principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoder (AE), are applied to investigate the linearity of the dataset. Since there is an imbalance on the dataset, a proportional weight is incorporated into the distance formula to get the fairness of the voting. A 5-fold cross validation-based evaluation shows that each proposed procedure works very well in enhancing the KNN. KMC is capable of increasing the accuracy of KNN from 81.6% to 86.7%. Combining KMC and PCA improves the KNN accuracy to be 90.9%. Next, a combination of KMC and AE enhances the KNN to gives an accuracy of 97.8%. Combining three proposed procedures of KMC, PCA, and Weighted KNN (WKNN) increases the accuracy to be 94.5%. Finally, the combination of KMC, AE, and WKNN reaches the highest accuracy of 98.3%. The facts that AE produces higher accuracies than PCA inform that the features in the dataset have a high non-linearity. © 2020 IEEE.","autoencoder; diabetes; k-means clustering; k-nearest neighbors; principal component analysis","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

In other words, the class imbalance occurs when the number of examples representing one class is much lower than the ones of the other classes. Hence, one or more classes may be underrepresented in the dataset. However, standard machine learning algorithms are usually biased toward the majority class, since rules correctly predicting those instances are positively weighted in favor of the accuracy metric or the corresponding cost function. As a consequence, minority class instances are more often misclassified than those from the majority one. One of the main issues in imbalanced problems is that usually, the underrepresented class is the class of interest of the problem from the application point of view. Therefore, there are a large number of researches on imbalanced learning. Compared with the binary class imbalanced problem, the multi-class imbalanced problem faces greater challenges, which is attributed to the diversity of class distribution and the insufficient performance of multi-class classifiers. Therefore, imbalanced problems have received more and more attention in recent years. This paper studies the mainstream imbalance algorithms, classifies the current models and algorithms to solve the imbalance problem, analyzes the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, discusses the performance indicators suitable for imbalance problems and their evaluation bias, and summarizes the research trend of algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.","Embedded Intelligent Computing; Imbalance Problem; Research Review","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Our research focuses on textual cyberbullying detection because text is the most common form of social media. However, the content information in social media is short, noisy, and unstructured with incorrect spellings and symbols, and this impacts the performance of some traditional machine learning methods based on vocabulary knowledge. For this reason, we propose a Char-CNNS (Character-level Convolutional Neural Network with Shortcuts) model to identify whether the text in social media contains cyberbullying. We use characters as the smallest unit of learning, enabling the model to overcome spelling errors and intentional obfuscation in real-world corpora. Shortcuts are utilized to stitch different levels of features to learn more granular bullying signals, and a focal loss function is adopted to overcome the class imbalance problem.

Risk factors such as peer pressure, permissive parenting, and impulsiveness make SUD more probable, whereas protective factors like community engagement alleviate this risk. No factor, however, is a sole determinant of SUD. The objective of this research is to build an ensemble learning framework to comprehensively predict adolescents at risk for SUD, considering the interplay between different factors. A data-driven model of 34 factors reflecting multiple dimensions of an adolescent's sphere of life, many of which comprise an adolescent's social network, is built from over 100 questions in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. These factors are split into two groups; Proximal includes characteristics that are individual-centric, whereas Distal includes environmental influences. A labeled data set is curated by pooling the observations from the 2016 and 2017 editions of the survey. Two ensemble classifiers are trained based on the labeled data set, while applying the SMOTE algorithm to consider class imbalance. Both classifiers can distinguish between adolescents with and without SUDs exceptionally accurately, with Area Under the ROC curve over 0.90, outperforming multivariate logistic regression, a commonly used model in public health studies. Obesity combined with being approached with drugs poses the highest risk from over 1000 interactions. It is possible that the legalization of marijuana may exacerbate this problem. Based on these findings, we may infer that SUD among adolescents may not be exclusively attributed to natural tendencies or environmental influences but arises from their confluence. © 2020 IEEE.","Adolescence; Machine Learning; Psychosocial Factors; Sociodemographic Factors; Substance Use Disorder","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, read depth at each locus is low, making sequencing error difficult to separate from actual variation. Prior to variant calling, sequencer reads are aligned to a reference genome, with alignments stored in Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) files. Each alignment has a mapping quality (MAPQ) score indicating the probability a read is incorrectly aligned. This study investigated the recalibration of probability estimates used to compute MAPQ scores for improving variant calling performance in single-sample, low-coverage settings. Materials and Methods: Simulated tomato, hot pepper and rice genomes were implanted with known variants. From these, simulated paired-end reads were generated at low coverage and aligned to the original reference genomes. Features extracted from the SAM formatted alignment files for tomato were used to train machine learning models to detect incorrectly aligned reads and output estimates of the probability of misalignment for each read in all three data sets. MAPQ scores were then re-computed from these estimates. Next, the SAM files were updated with new MAPQ scores. Finally, Variant calling was performed on the original and recalibrated alignments and the results compared. Results: Incorrectly aligned reads comprised only 0.16% of the reads in the training set. This severe class imbalance required special consideration for model training. The F1 score for detecting misaligned reads ranged from 0.76 to 0.82. The best performing model was used to compute new MAPQ scores. Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) detection was improved after mapping score recalibration. In rice, recall for called SNPs increased by 5.2%, while for tomato and pepper it increased by 3.1% and 1.5%, respectively. For all three data sets the precision of SNP calls ranged from 0.91 to 0.95, and was largely unchanged both before and after mapping score recalibration. Conclusion: Recalibrating MAPQ scores delivers modest improvements in single-sample variant calling results. Some variant callers operate on multiple samples simultaneously. They exploit every sample’s reads to compensate for the low read-depth of individual samples. This improves polymorphism detection and genotype inference. It may be that small improvements in single-sample settings translate to larger gains in a multi-sample experiment. A study to investigate this is ongoing.

The computer model of such methods is an ensemble classification which combines prediction of a number base classifier trained by various machine learning techniques. The predictive sample in the educational process is always not balanced-it leads to a shift in estimates. The basic idea of this work is that the binary forecasting on unbalanced datasets is carried out by a Meta-classifier-an ensemble of different classification algorithm (Decision tree J48, Naive base NB, Multilayer perception MLP, k-Neighbour Nearest k-NN and Support Vector Machine SVM) which trained by stacking, bagging and boosting procedures on SMOTE, RUS, ROS balanced samples. The experiments conducted on moderately unbalanced dataset of 350 tuples of student data with using simple voting Meta-ensemble models, show that the best overall accuracy A and F1 measure of minority class were achieved by the Meta-ensembles containing 5-15 members classifiers trained on samples prepared by SMOTE.It is also proposed that these of Meta-ensembles can be used to resolve quantification learning problem-novel task to predict collective performance. As in our recent works the deterministic outputs of Meta-ensemble members can be transformed to probabilistic outputs and then to prediction of class frequency. After analyzing the results of quantification, it becomes obvious that the most optimal design of the meta-ensembles is to collect pre-boosted classifiers trained on the SMOTE sample. © 2020 IEEE.","Bagging; Boosting; Ensemble Classification; Imbalance Dataset; Meta-Ensemble; Quantification; Re-Sampling; Stacking","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

This is followed by a rapid increase of pot voltage from about 4.3 V to values in the range from 10 to 80 V. As a result of a local depletion of oxide ions, the cryolite decomposes and forms climate-relevant perfluorocarbon (PFC) gases. The high pot voltage also causes a high energy input, which dissipates as heat. In order to ensure energy-efficient and climate-friendly operation, it is important to predict anode effects in advance so that they can be prevented by prophylactic actions like alumina feeding or beam downward movements. In this paper a classification model is trained with aggregated time series data from TRIMET Aluminium SE Essen (TAE) that is able to predict anode effects at least 1 min in advance. Due to a high imbalance in the class distribution of normal state and labeled anode effect state as well as possible model’s weaknesses the final F1 score of 32.4% is comparatively low.

Yet some people use Twitter to propagate violent and threatening messages resulting in cyberbullying. Previous research has focused on whether cyberbullying behavior exists or not in a tweet (binary classification). In this research, we developed a model for detecting the severity of cyberbullying in a tweet. The developed model is a feature-based model that uses features from the content of a tweet, to develop a machine learning classifier for classifying the tweets as non-cyberbullied, and low, medium, or high-level cyberbullied tweets. In this study, we introduced pointwise semantic orientation as a new input feature along with utilizing predicted features (gender, age, and personality type) and Twitter API features. Results from experiments with our proposed framework in a multi-class setting are promising both with respect to Kappa (84%), classifier accuracy (93%), and F-measure (92%) metric. Overall, 40% of the classifiers increased performance in comparison with baseline approaches. Our analysis shows that features with the highest odd ratio: for detecting low-level severity include: age group between 19–22 years and users with <1 year of Twitter account activation; for medium-level severity: neuroticism, age group between 23–29 years, and being a Twitter user between one to two years; and for high-level severity: neuroticism and extraversion, and the number of times tweet has been favorited by other users. We believe that this research using a multi-class classification approach provides a step forward in identifying severity at different levels (low, medium, high) when the content of a tweet is classified as cyberbullied. Lastly, the current study only focused on the Twitter platform; other social network platforms can be investigated using the same approach to detect cyberbullying severity patterns. © 2020 by the authors.

For instance, the distribution of the training process to a myriad of devices limits the classification performance of machine learning (ML) algorithms, often showing a significantly degraded accuracy compared to centralized learning. In this paper, we investigate the problem of performance limitation under FL and present the benefit of data augmentation with an application of anomaly detection using an IoT dataset. Our initial study reveals that one of the critical reasons for the performance degradation is that each device sees only a small fraction of data (that it generates), which limits the efficacy of the local ML model (constructed by the device). This becomes more critical if the data holds the class imbalance problem, observed not infrequently in practice (e.g., a small fraction of anomalies). Moreover, device heterogeneity with respect to data quantity is an open challenge in FL. Based on these observations, we examine the impact of data augmentation on detection performance in FL settings (both homogeneous and heterogeneous).

First, we leverage and compare two types of missing data imputation methods: 1) mean-based and 2) similarity-based, increasing the completeness of this dataset. Second, we propose a feature selection and evaluation model based on using undersampling with Ensemble Learning to address class imbalance present in the dataset. We leverage and compare multiple Ensemble Feature selection methods, including Complete Linear Aggregation (CLA), Weighted Mean Aggregation (WMA), Feature Occurrence Frequency (OFA) and Classification Accuracy Based Aggregation (CAA). To further address missing data present in each feature, we propose two novel methods: 1) Missing Data Rate and Accuracy Based Aggregation (MAA), and 2) Entropy and Accuracy Based Aggregation (EAA). Both proposed models balance the degree of data variance introduced by the missing data handling during the feature selection process, while maintaining model performance. Our results show a 42% improvement in sensitivity versus fallout over previous state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 IEEE.","Machine Learning; Preterm Birth","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

A novel algorithm is proposed in this paper which decides an optimal policy to draw a balanced data sample from clustered raw data with class imbalance. The proposed Bayesian network model trades off accuracy with redefined Bayesian balance to find the optimal policy.

The most commonly used loss function for classification is cross entropy. In image segmentation problems where each pixel is assigned to a particular class, overlap-based losses have recently been shown to improve classifier performance especially for datasets with an imbalanced class distribution. This is particu-larly relevant to segmentation because class imbalance mitigation strategies used in regular classification are often not applicable. Overlap-based losses, however, have different drawbacks. We are aiming at combining the upsides of different losses with a simple scheduling scheme during training while minimizing their downsides. Gradually transitioning from an overlap-based dice loss to cross entropy allows to reliably select a distinct minimum in the optimization landscape as a valuable alternative to results obtained from traditional unscheduled loss functions. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on different combinations of loss functions, datasets, and models. © 2020 IEEE.","Class Im-balance; Cross Entropy; Dice Loss; Loss Scheduling; Machine Learning; Model Calibration; Pixel Classification; Semantic Segmentation; Transfer Learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

An effective model can optimize the allocation of testing resources, thus improving the quality of software products. Most previous studies use handcrafted features to represent code snippets, but the main problem is that it is difficult to capture the semantic and structural information of the code context, which is often crucial for software defect prediction. Meanwhile, most of the existing software defect prediction models cannot make predictions at the code line level, which makes it extremely arduous to provide developers with more detailed reference information. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a model based on ensemble learning techniques and attention mechanisms to offer more comprehensive prediction information to developers by locating suspect lines of code when making method-level defect predictions. This model leverages abstract syntax trees (ASTs) as the intermediate representation of code snippets. Since the historical defect data has a striking characteristic of class-imbalance, an approach based on Self-organizing Map (SOM) clustering is employed to handle noisy data. Experimental results show that, on average, the proposed model improves the F-measure by 17.7% and AUC by 37.8%, compared with the other four machine learning algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.","Attention model; Deep learning; Ensemble learning; Software defect prediction","IEEE Computer Society"

Machine learning techniques can be used for early diagnosis of diabetes so that individuals can adapt to better lifestyle habits and diet plan to prevent further complications of symptoms. In this paper we have implemented an efficient model to classify type-2 diabetes using a hybrid approach. The dataset which is relatively imbalanced with respect to the number of diabetic or non-diabetic individuals was obtained from the Biostatistics program of Vanderbilt University, USA which contains parameters like Glucose, Age, Cholesterol, Weight, Waist/Hip ratio of 390 African-American individuals. The features from the dataset were obtained by filter and wrapper methods. The dataset was balanced by applying oversampling and undersampling methods. A voting ensemble model consisting of 5 algorithms was then used as a classifier with model validation done using stratified K-fold technique. The model's performance was assessed using recall, precision, F1 score and accuracy. The results obtained by comparison of the models with and without sampling have shown significant improvements in recall.

A tube-tree is a collection of tubes building from the combination of the input attributes where an internal node contains distinct class tubes corresponding to their respective classes. A tube composes of three components: a core vector, a tube length, and a tube radius built for each class regardless of its size suitable for an imbalance dataset.

One of these challenges is privacy. However, there is a tension between privacy, utility (model accuracy), and fairness. While de-identification techniques, such as generalisation and suppression, have been proposed to enable privacy protection, it comes with a cost, specifically to fairness and utility. Recent work on algorithmic fairness defines fairness as a guarantee of similar outputs for 'similar' inputs. This notion is discussed in connection to de-identification. This research investigates the trade-off between privacy, fairness, and utility. In contrast, other work investigates the trade-off between privacy and overall utility. In this research, we investigate the effects of two de-identification techniques, k-anonymity and differential privacy, on both utility and fairness. We propose two measures to calculate the trade-off between privacy-utility and privacy-fairness. Other research has provided guarantees for privacy regarding utility; this research focuses on the trade-offs given set de-identification levels and relies on these guarantees.

Accurate prediction of AMI readmission is a crucial way to identify the high-risk group and optimize the distribution of medical resources. Methods: In this study, we propose a stacking-based model to predict the risk of 30-day unplanned all-cause hospital readmissions for AMI patients based on clinical data. Firstly,we conducted an under-sampling method of neighborhood cleaning rule (NCR) to alleviate the class imbalance and then utilized a feature selection method of SelectFromModel (SFM) to select effective features. Secondly, we adopted a self-adaptive approach to select base classifiers from eight candidate models according to their performances in datasets. Finally, we constructed a three-layer stacking model in which layer 1 and layer 2 were base-layer and level 3 was meta-layer. The predictions of the base-layer were used to train the meta-layer in order to make the final forecast. Results: The results show that the proposed model exhibits the highest AUC (0.720), which is higher than that of decision tree (0.681), support vector machine (0.707), random forest (0.701), extra trees (0.709), adaBoost (0.702), bootstrap aggregating (0.704), gradient boosting decision tree (0.710) and extreme gradient enhancement (0.713).

This work aims to deploy soft-computing and machine learning techniques for early prediction of sepsis. Design: An algorithm for early identification of sepsis using ratio and power-based feature transformation of easily obtainable clinical data. Setting: PhysioNet Challenge 2019 provided ICU data from three separate hospital systems. Publicly shared data from two hospital systems are used for training and validation purposes, whereas sequestered data from all the three systems is used for testing. Patients: Over 60,000 ICU patients with up to 40 clinical variables are sourced for each hour of their ICU stay. The Sepsis-3 criterion is applied for annotation. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The clinical feature exploration for early prediction of sepsis is achieved using the proposed framework named genetic algorithm optimized ratio and power-based expert algorithm. An optimal feature set containing 46 ratio and power-based features is computed from the given patient covariates using genetic algorithm optimized ratio and power-based expert and grouped with identified 17 raw features and 55 statistical features to form a final feature set of 118 clinical features to predict the onset of sepsis in the proceeding 6 hours. The obtained features are fed to a hybrid Random Under-Sampling-Boosting algorithm, called RUSBoost for alleviating the involved class imbalance. The optimal RUSBoost model has achieved a normalized utility score of 0.318 on full test data. Conclusions: The proposed study supports the realization of a hospital-specific customized solution in the form of an early-warning system for sepsis. However, an extended analysis is necessary to apply this framework for hospital-independent diagnosis of sepsis in general. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of hospital-specific customized solutions based on the proposed method across a wide range of hospital systems needs to be studied.

In practice, myopathies are frequently encountered by physicians and precise diagnosis remains a challenge in primary care. Molecular expression profiles show promise for disease diagnosis in various pathologies. We propose a novel machine learning-based clinical tool for predicting muscle disease subtypes using multi-cohort microarray expression data. Materials and methods: Muscle tissue samples originating from 1260 patients with muscle weakness. Data was curated from 42 independent cohorts with expression profiles in public microarray gene expression repositories, which represent a broad range of patient ages and peripheral muscles. Cohorts were categorized into five muscle disease subtypes: immobility, inflammatory myopathies, intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW), congenital, and chronic systemic disease. The data contains expression data on 34,099 genes. Data augmentation techniques were used to address class imbalances in the muscle disease subtypes. Support vector machine (SVM) models were trained on two-thirds of the 1260 samples based on the top selected gene signature using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The model was validated in the remaining samples using area under the receiver operator curve (AUC). Gene enrichment analysis was used to identify enriched biological functions in the gene signature. Results: The AUC ranges from 0.611 to 0.649 in the observed imbalanced data. Overall, using the augmented data, chronic systemic disease was the best predicted class with AUC 0.872 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.824–0.920). The least discriminated classes were ICUAW with AUC 0.777 (95% CI: 0.668–0.887) and immobility with AUC 0.789 (95% CI: 0.716–0.861). Disease-specific gene set enrichment results showed that the gene signature was enriched in biological processes including neural precursor cell proliferation for ICUAW and aerobic respiration for congenital (false discovery rate q-value < 0.001). Conclusion: Our results present a well-performing molecular classification tool with the selected gene markers for muscle disease classification. In practice, this tool addresses an important gap in the literature on myopathies and presents a potentially useful clinical tool for muscle disease subtype diagnosis. © 2020, The Author(s).","Biomarker; Clinical tool; Machine learning; Microarray; Muscle diseases","BioMed Central Ltd"

The data are retrieved from the nationally representative Household Budget Survey collected in 2012 by the Turkish Statistical Institute. In total, 9987 households returned valid survey responses. The predictive models are based on eight common risk factors of catastrophic OOP health expenditure. The minority class in the training dataset is oversampled by using a synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) function, and the original and balanced oversampled training datasets are used to establish the classification models. Logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF) (100 trees), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network (NN) are determined as classifiers. The weighted percentage of households faced with catastrophic OOP health expenditure is 0.14. Balanced oversampling increases the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of LR, RF, SVM, and NN by 0.08%, 0.62%, 0.20%, and 0.23%, respectively. The ROC curve shows NN and RF to be the best classifiers for a balanced oversampled dataset. Identifying a classifier to model highly imbalanced catastrophic OOP health expenditure requires the two-stage procedure of (i) considering a balance between classes and (ii) comparing alternative classifiers. NN and RF are good classifiers in a prediction task with imbalanced catastrophic OOP health expenditure data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Catastrophic out-of-pocket health expenditure; Neural network; Oversampling; Random forest; SMOTE; Unbalanced data","Elsevier B.V."

We evaluate CatBoost and XGBoost on the task of Medicare fraud detection, and report performance in terms of running time and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC).

Moreover, we conduct experiments to find the optimal number of decision trees to use for XGBoost and CatBoost in the task of Medicare fraud detection. This is an important contribution because the number of trees in the ensemble governs overall resource consumption of a Gradient Boosted Decision Tree implementation. We find that with a purely numerical dataset, CatBoost and XGBoost yield nearly equivalent performance in terms of AUC, and XGBoost has a shorter training time. With respect to Medicare fraud detection, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the performance of CatBoost and XGBoost in terms of running time and AUC on highly imbalanced, Big Data.

A machine learning algorithm (classifier) trained with an imbalanced dataset predicts the majority class (frequently occurring) more than the other minority classes (rarely occurring). Training with an imbalanced dataset poses challenges for classifiers; however, applying suitable techniques for reducing class imbalance issues can enhance classifiers’ performance. In this study, we consider an imbalanced dataset from an educational context. Initially, we examine all shortcomings regarding the classification of an imbalanced dataset. Then, we apply data-level algorithms for class balancing and compare the performance of classifiers. The performance of the classifiers is measured using the underlying information in their confusion matrices, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F measure. The results show that classification with an imbalanced dataset may produce high accuracy but low precision and recall for the minority class.

Its accurate detection is a challenge since sometimes patients do not experience any prior alert to identify a seizure. Electroencephalography (EEG) recordings are used for seizure detection, but these are usually of longer duration, and as a result, the behavior of the inherent data set is highly imbalanced. To detect seizures in such a scenario is a challenging task; using a typical classifier such as decision tree and decision forest can result in highly skewed class value (non-seizure), causing incorrect detection of epileptic patients. To solve this, a cost-sensitive learning method with a random forest was used. An algorithm that helps in seizure detection by penalizing the cost of a false negative concerning the duration of an EEG recording was proposed. The experimental results show that executing the classifier without penalty or inadequate penalties to the cost matrix is not a satisfactory solution. As a result, the algorithm provides up to 100% recall, which means all the seizure seconds are detected. The proposed method substantiates achieving higher actual seizure detection rates; the imposed penalty should be equal to the time duration of the EEG recordings (in seconds) for a patient. Hence, it can be potentially applied to the pre-consultation to the neurologist at the Outpatient Department for the actual seizure detection cases and refer them to the neurology department for further consultation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Class imbalance; Classification; Cost-sensitive learning; Decision forest; Epilepsy; Epilepsy monitoring unit; Scalp EEG; Seizure detection","Springer-Verlag Italia s.r.l."

PMG frequently associates with seizures. The molecular pathomechanisms underlying PMG development are not yet understood. About 40 genes have been associated with PMG, and small copy number variations have also been described in selected patients. We recently provided evidence that epilepsy-associated structural brain lesions can be classified based on genomic DNA methylation patterns. Here, we analyzed 26 PMG patients employing array-based DNA methylation profiling on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded material. A series of 62 well-characterized non-PMG cortical malformations (focal cortical dysplasia type 2a/b and hemimegalencephaly), temporal lobe epilepsy, and non-epilepsy autopsy controls was used as reference cohort. Unsupervised dimensionality reduction and hierarchical cluster analysis of DNA methylation profiles showed that PMG formed a distinct DNA methylation class. Copy number profiling from DNA methylation data identified a uniform duplication spanning the entire long arm of chromosome 1 in 7 out of 26 PMG patients, which was verified by additional fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. In respective cases, about 50% of nuclei in the center of the PMG lesion were 1q triploid. No chromosomal imbalance was seen in adjacent, architecturally normal-appearing tissue indicating mosaicism. Clinically, PMG 1q patients presented with a unilateral frontal or hemispheric PMG without hemimegalencephaly, a severe form of intractable epilepsy with seizure onset in the first months of life, and severe developmental delay. Our results show that PMG can be classified among other structural brain lesions according to their DNA methylation profile. One subset of PMG with distinct clinical features exhibits a duplication of chromosomal arm 1q. © 2020, The Author(s).","Brain development; Chromosome 1; Copy number variation; Cortical malformation; ID; Seizures","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

This paper presents a thorough investigation of the effects of class imbalance and methods for mitigating class imbalance in ML algorithms applied to MI. Methods: We first selected five classes from the Image Retrieval in Medical Applications (IRMA) dataset, performed multiclass classification using the random forest model (RFM), and then performed binary classification using convolutional neural network (CNN) on a chest X-ray dataset. An imbalanced class was created in the training set by varying the number of images in that class. Methods tested to mitigate class imbalance included oversampling, undersampling, and changing class weights of the RFM. Model performance was assessed by overall classification accuracy, overall F1 score, and specificity, recall, and precision of the imbalanced class. Results: A close-to-balanced training set resulted in the best model performance, and a large imbalance with overrepresentation was more detrimental to model performance than underrepresentation. Oversampling and undersampling methods were both effective in mitigating class imbalance, and efficacy of oversampling techniques was class specific. Conclusion: This study systematically demonstrates the effect of class imbalance on two public X-ray datasets on RFM and CNN, making these findings widely applicable as a reference. Furthermore, the methods employed here can guide researchers in assessing and addressing the effects of class imbalance, while considering the data-specific characteristics to optimize imbalance mitigating methods. © 2020, CARS.","Class imbalance; Machine learning; Medical imaging; Radiology; X-ray","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

This study presents an ensemble learning model based on classification and regression tree (CART) and AdaBoost algorithm to predict the classification of surrounding rock mass. Statistical indicators (i.e., mean value and standard deviation) of TBM operational parameters were calculated and used as input variables, and the rock mass classification obtained by the hydropower classification (HC) method was used as output variable. To develop the model, a database was established, consisting of 3166 samples collected from the Songhua River Water Conveyance Tunnel. The synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was utilized to address the imbalance ratio of rock mass classifications in the database. The results of the testing set showed that the accuracy and F1-measure of AdaBoost-CART were 0.865 and 0.770, respectively, which are better than the results of the standard CART (0.753 and 0.629, respectively). The application of SMOTE improves the recall of minority classes. Compared with artificial neural networks, k-nearest neighbor, and support vector classifier, the developed AdaBoost-CART model achieves better performance. The variable importance was analyzed to distinguish key features; the results showed that rock mass boreability may not be a major consideration of the HC method. The presented model can provide significant guidance for the real-time acquisition of surrounding rock information during TBM tunneling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","AdaBoost-CART model; Integrated algorithm; Rock mass classification; SMOTE; TBM","Elsevier Ltd"

Although many researchers have presented different approaches to get a robust SVM, the work on robust SVM based on rescaled hinge loss function (RSVM-RHHQ) has attracted a great deal of attention. The method of using correntropy with hinge loss function has added a noticeable amount of robustness to the model. However, the sparsity of the model can be further improved. In this work, we focus on enhancing the sparsity of RSVM-RHHQ. As this work is the improved version of the RSVM-RHHQ, we follow the same track (of adding noise in the data) of RSVM-RHHQ with altogether a new problem formulation. We apply correntropy to the α-hinge loss function, which results in a better loss function than the rescaled hinge loss function. We use a non-smooth regularizer with a non-convex and non-smooth loss function. We solve this non-smooth and non-convex problem using the primal–dual proximal method. We find that this combination not only adds sparsity to the model, but it is also better than the existing robust SVM methods in terms of robustness towards label noise. We also provide the convergence proof of the proposed approach. In addition, the time complexity of the optimization technique is included. We perform experiments over various publicly available real-world data sets to compare the proposed method with the existing robust SVM methods. For experimentation purposes, we use small data sets, large data sets, and also data sets with significant class imbalance. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods in sparseness, accuracy, and robustness. We also provide the sensitivity analysis of the regularization parameter for the label noise in the data set. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Non-smooth regularizer; Primal–dual proximal method; Rescaled α-hinge loss; Robust statistics; Sparsity; Support vector machine","Springer"

Specifically, the macro and micro F-measure metrics are adopted as the optimization functions for ADT-ELM, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to determine the optimal decision threshold combination.

These developments demand reconsideration of the privacy-security dilemma, which describes the tradeoffs between national security interests and individual privacy concerns. By investigating mass surveillance techniques that use bulk data collection and machine learning algorithms, we show why these methods are unlikely to pinpoint terrorists in order to prevent attacks. The diverse characteristics of terrorist attacks—especially when considering lone-wolf terrorism—lead to irregular and isolated (digital) footprints. The irregularity of data affects the accuracy of machine learning algorithms and the mass surveillance that depends on them which can be explained by three kinds of known problems encountered in machine learning theory: class imbalance, the curse of dimensionality, and spurious correlations. Proponents of mass surveillance often invoke the distinction between collecting data and metadata, in which the latter is understood as a lesser breach of privacy. Their arguments commonly overlook the ambiguity in the definitions of data and metadata and ignore the ability of machine learning techniques to infer the former from the latter. Given the sparsity of datasets used for machine learning in counterterrorism and the privacy risks attendant with bulk data collection, policymakers and other relevant stakeholders should critically re-evaluate the likelihood of success of the algorithms and the collection of data on which they depend. © 2020, The Author(s).","Machine learning; Mass surveillance; Metadata collection; National security; Privacy-security dilemma","Springer Science and Business Media B.V."

Although many methods have been used for the imbalanced data classification, there are still problems with low classification accuracy in minority class and adding additional parameter settings. In order to increase minority classification accuracy in imbalanced problem, this paper proposes a parameter-free weighting learning mechanism based on extreme learning machine and sample loss values to balance the number of samples in each training step. The proposed method mainly includes two aspects: the sample weight learning process based on the sample losses; the sample selection process and weight update process according to the constraint function and iterations.

However, current studies reveal that a small subset of gene makers can predict survivability for people with different breast cancer subtypes. In these studies, the selected genes are not necessarily functionally related, and hence, they may not correctly indicate the molecular mechanism behind breast cancer survivability. Also, several studies have shown there is a very low overlap between the biomarkers subsets for the same cancer disease. To improve the robustness of the classification performance and stability of detected biomarkers, recent methods involve taking existing knowledge on relations between genes into account in the classifier by aggregating functionality-related genes to produce discriminative gene subnetworks called network biomarkers. Results: In this paper, using a dataset of patients with different subtypes of breast cancer, we devised a novel network-based approach by integrating a protein–protein interaction (PPI) network with gene expression data to (1) identify the network biomarkers (metagene) of breast cancer survivability and (2) predict the survivability of breast cancer patients based on their subtypes of breast cancer. Our method involves using the concept of seed genes for the identification of network biomarkers, ADASYN to solve class-imbalance, and random forest to predict the survivability of patients. We obtained the best classification performance with distance three from seed gene protein where the Gmean, F1-measure, and accuracy were respectively 0.900, 0.800, and 90.34%. The maximum size of a network biomarker with distance 3 is 9. A maximum of 34 genes is needed to accurately predict the survivability of breast cancer patients. Conclusion: This method can be used to identify the survivability of breast cancer patients using gene relationship networks. It has high prediction performance, including specificity and sensitivity for both cohorts of survivals and deceased. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Breast cancer subtypes; Gene expression; Protein–protein interaction network; Survivability","Springer"

This difference may be critical enough to impact the effectiveness of the machine learning model. In our paper, we investigate the relationship between time and predictive model maintenance. Our work incorporates severely imbalanced big data from three Medicare datasets, namely Part D, DMEPOS, and Combined, that have been used in several fraud detection studies. We build training datasets from year-groupings of 2013, 2014, 2015, 2013–2014, 2014–2015, and 2013–2015. Our test datasets are built from the 2016 data. To mitigate some of the adverse effects from the severe class imbalance in these datasets, the performance of five class ratios obtained by Random Undersampling and five learners is evaluated by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric. The models producing the best values are as follows: Logistic Regression with the 2015 year-grouping at a 99:1 class ratio (Part D); Random Forest with the 2014-2015 year-grouping at a 75:25 class ratio (DMEPOS); and Logistic Regression with the full 2015 year-grouping (Combined). Our experimental results show that the largest training dataset (year-grouping 2013–2015) was not among the selected choices, which indicates that the 2013 data may be outdated. Moreover, we note that because the best model is different for Part D, DMEPOS, and Combined, this suggests that these three datasets may actually be sub-domains requiring unique models within the Medicare fraud detection domain. © 2020, The Author(s).","Big data; Class imbalance; Machine learning; Model maintenance; Undersampling","Springer"

Synthetic oversampling methods are commonly used to tackle these problems by generating minority class samples to balance the majority and minority classes. Two major issues will influence the performance of oversampling methods which are how to choose the most appropriate existing minority seed samples, and how to synthesize new samples from seed samples effectively. However, many existing oversampling methods are not accurate and effective enough to generate new samples when dealing with high-dimensional faulty samples with different imbalanced ratios, since they do not take these two factors into consideration at the same time. This article develops a novel adaptive oversampling technique: expectation maximization (EM)-based local-weighted minority oversampling technique for industrial fault diagnostics. This method uses a local-weighted minority oversampling strategy to identify hard-to-learn informative minority fault samples and an EM-based imputation algorithm to generate fault samples based on the distribution of minority samples. To validate the performance of the developed method, experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets. The results show that the developed method can achieve better performances, in terms of F-measure, Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), and Mean (average of F-measure and MCC) values, on multiclass imbalanced fault diagnostics in different imbalance ratios than state-of-arts' baseline sampling techniques. © 1963-2012 IEEE.","Class-imbalance learning; fault diagnostics; machine learning; prognostics and health management (PHM); synthetic oversampling","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

With regard to datasets, class imbalance can bias the predictive capabilities of Machine Learning algorithms towards the majority (negative) class, and in situations where false negatives incur a greater penalty than false positives, this imbalance may lead to adverse consequences. Our paper incorporates two case studies, each utilizing a unique approach of three learners (gradient-boosted trees, logistic regression, random forest) and three performance metrics (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve, Geometric Mean) to investigate class rarity in big data. Class rarity, a notably extreme degree of class imbalance, was effected in our experiments by randomly removing minority (positive) instances to artificially generate eight subsets of gradually decreasing positive class instances. All model evaluations were performed through Cross-Validation. In the first case study, which uses a Medicare Part B dataset, performance scores for the learners generally improve with the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric as the rarity level decreases, while corresponding scores with the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve and Geometric Mean metrics show no improvement. In the second case study, which uses a dataset built from Distributed Denial of Service attack attack data (POSTSlowloris Combined), the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric produces very high-performance scores for the learners, with all subsets of positive class instances. For the second study, scores for the learners generally improve with the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve and Geometric Mean metrics as the rarity level decreases. Overall, with regard to both case studies, the Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT) learner performs the best. © 2020, The Author(s).","Big data; Class imbalance; Class rarity; Machine learning; Medicare fraud; POSTSlowloris; Undersampling","Springer"

Section 2 Related work Finally, we also examine a different set of network categories […]. Despite these differences, we see our work and [8] as complementary and confirmatory of one another. Both works convey the overall message that a network’s category can be predicted with high accuracy, and that similarities and differences between categories can lead to interesting insights. In a similar vein, but with a more limited scope of features, [9] presented a taxonomy of networks based on community structures. Section 3.2.1. Real-world network data Our data include several small classes (e.g., Ecology, Web, and Road) with less than 20 entries and several large classes with over 100 networks (e.g., Facebook and Cheminformatics). This creates a challenge when performing classification due to class imbalance [3]. Such class imbalance is a widely recognized problem in machine learning [4, 5]. While our work has taken very basic steps to address this problem (see next paragraph), we recognize that the models learned with the current data set may not be well trained for the smaller classes. This does not take away from our overall findings that the categories, and especially the synthetic models, are highly distinguishable. A key step in the extension of this work, both for deployability and future research, is to expand the training data used for our models or use one or more of the recently developed techniques for addressing imbalance in such classification problems. For example, see Zhang et al. [10]. Down-Sampling Process. To down-sample cheminformatics, the networks were clustered using a k-nearest neighbor algorithm [6]. The networks formed four clusters based on an elbow plot. From each cluster, we then randomly selected 20% of the networks. After a down-sampling process, the subset of cheminformatics had 119 networks. [1] Rossi, R.A., Ahmed, N.K. Complex networks are structurally distinguishable by domain. Soc. Netw. Anal.

If the required sample size for accurate model performance can be determined early, then resources can be allocated appropriately to minimize time and cost. In this study, we explore sample size determination methods for four real-world biomedical datasets, spanning genomics, proteomics, electronic health records, and insurance claims data, all with millions of instances each and<2% class ratio. The methods used involve approximating a learning curve for a large amount of data using a small amount of data. We evaluate an existing method that fits an inverse power law model to a small learning curve and introduce a novel semi-supervised method that utilizes the large amount of unlabeled data for estimating a learning curve. We find that the inverse power law method is applicable to big data, while the semi-supervised method can be better at detecting convergence. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply an inverse power law curve fitting method to big data with limited labels and compare it to a semi-supervised approach. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Big data; Class imbalance; Learning curve; Limited labels; Sample size determination","Springer"

The data is curated from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) with the goal of predicting the occurrence of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD). While the majority of the existing machine learning models that have been used on this class of data are vulnerable to class imbalance even after the adjustment of class-specific weights, our simple two-layer CNN exhibits resilience to the imbalance with fair harmony in class-specific performance. Given a highly imbalanced dataset, it is often challenging to simultaneously achieve a high class 1 (true CHD prediction rate) accuracy along with a high class 0 accuracy, as the test data size increases. We adopt a two-step approach: first, we employ least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) based feature weight assessment followed by majority-voting based identification of important features. Next, the important features are homogenized by using a fully connected layer, a crucial step before passing the output of the layer to successive convolutional stages. We also propose a training routine per epoch, akin to a simulated annealing process, to boost the classification accuracy. Despite a high class imbalance in the NHANES dataset, the investigation confirms that our proposed CNN architecture has the classification power of 77% to correctly classify the presence of CHD and 81.8% to accurately classify the absence of CHD cases on a testing data, which is 85.70% of the total dataset. This result signifies that the proposed architecture can be generalized to other studies in healthcare with a similar order of features and imbalances. While the recall values obtained from other machine learning methods, such as SVM and random forest, are comparable to that of our proposed CNN model, our model predicts the negative (Non-CHD) cases with higher accuracy. Our model architecture exhibits a way forward to develop better investigative tools, improved medical treatment and lower diagnostic costs by incorporating a smart diagnostic system in the healthcare system. The balanced accuracy of our model (79.5%) is also better than individual accuracies of SVM or random forest classifiers. The CNN classifier results in high specificity and test accuracy along with high values of recall and area under the curve (AUC). © 2020","Artificial Intelligence; Convolutional neural network; Coronary heart disease; LASSO regression; Machine learning; NHANES","Elsevier Ltd"

In the machine learning algorithm, the imbalance problem appears when the number of one class samples are significantly minor than another class. In order to solve the imbalance problem of a dataset, multiple algorithms are proposed in the field of machine learning and especially in deep learning. In this study, we have benefited from weighted binary cross-entropy in the learning process as a loss function instead of ordinary cross-entropy (binary cross-entropy). This model allocates more penalty to minority class samples during the learning process, and it makes that minority class samples are detected more accurately. Finally, we could improve Recall with preserving Accuracy.

PLs can strongly influence deep ocean water formation since they are associated with strong surface winds and heat fluxes. Detection and tracking of PLs are crucial for understanding the climatological dynamics of PLs and for the analysis of their impacts on other components of the climatic system. At the same time, visual tracking of PLs is a highly time-consuming procedure that requires expert knowledge and extensive examination of source data. There are known procedures involving deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for the detection of large-scale atmospheric phenomena in reanalysis data that demonstrate a high quality of detection. However, one cannot apply these procedures to satellite data directly since, unlike reanalyses, satellite products register all the scales of atmospheric vortices. It is also known that DCNNs were originally designed to be scale-invariant. This leads to the problem of filtering of the scale of detected phenomena. There are other problems to be solved, such as low signal-to-noise ratio of satellite data, and an unbalanced number of negative (without PLs) and positive (where a PL is presented) classes in a satellite dataset. In our study, we propose a deep learning approach for the detection of PLs and PMCs in remote sensing data, which addresses class imbalance and scale filtering problems.

This will certainly make the resulting model have less than maximum performance because theoretically, the single classifier has a weakness to the class imbalance conditions in datasets, this is because the majority of single classifier tends to work by recognizing patterns in the majority class in datasets that are not balanced so that the performance is not can be the maximum. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with these problems. In this study proposing an algorithmic level approach using Random Forest and Stacking to deal with these problems, thebasic idea of using an algorithmic level approach is not to change the composition or pattern contained in the dataset itself. Based on tests using 5 datasets with different imbalance ratios, it shows that Random Forests or Bagging Tree and Stacking Naïve Bayes and Decision Tree C4.5 can produce better performance than single classifiers such as SVM, Naïve Bayes, and Decision Tree C4.5. So, the proposed method can be a solution in handling class imbalance in the dataset with different imbalance ratios. © 2020 IEEE.","Classification; Ensemble; Imbalanced Class; Random Forest; Stacking","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The problem of class imbalance is mostly found during classifications in the real world where one class is very small in number (minority class) while the other classes are very numerous (majority in class). Building a learning algorithm model without considering the problem of class imbalance causes the learning model to be flooded by majority class instances so that it ignores minority class predictions. Random undersampling and oversampling techniques have been widely used in various studies to overcome class imbalances. In this study using the undersampling strategy with clustering techniques while the classification model uses C4.5. Clustering is used to group data and the undersampling process is performed on eachdata group. The goal is that sample samples that are useful are not eliminated. Statistical test results from experiments using 10 imbalance datasets from KEEL-repository dan Kaggle dataset with various sample sizes indicate that clustering-based undersampling produces satisfactory performance.

The use of machine learning methods for predicting software defects can be applied to predict defects in each software module. However, basically the software defect prediction dataset has two problems, namely class imbalance with very few defective modules compared to non-defective modules and contains noisy attributes due to irrelevant features. With these two problems, it will result in overfitting and lead to biased classification results so that it will have an impact on significantly reducing the performance of the machine learning model. In this study, we propose the implementation of bagging techniques and genetic algorithms to improve the classification performance of machine learning models in predicting software defects based Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, Decision Tree. Bagging techniques and Genetic algorithms are approaches that can handle two main problems in software defects prediction, each of which can handle the class imbalance and feature selection problem.

These data can be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design and operations towards energy efficiency and well-being. By nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor conditions are designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are less common. This situation creates a scenario for the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might be valuable for developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with high-performance. This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset class balancing techniques from the literature and proposes a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), comfortGAN, to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly available datasets, ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection of thermal comfort datasets, with 1,474; 2,067; and 66,397 data points, respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from comfortGAN, has higher performance (increase between 4% and 17% in classification accuracy) than other augmentation methods tested. However, when classes representing discomfort are merged and reduced to three, better imbalanced performance is expected, and the additional increase in performance by comfortGAN shrinks to 1 - 2%. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value is diminished in certain scenarios. A discussion is provided to assist potential users in determining which scenarios this process is useful and which method works best. © 2020 ACM.","Buildings; Class Balancing; Data Augmentation; Generative Adversarial Network; Machine Learning; Survey; Thermal Comfort","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc"

Over the past decades, increasing attention has been paid towards the issue of class imbalance and this is now a research hotspot in a variety of fields. Although the resampling methods, either by under-sampling the majority class or by over-sampling the minority class, stand among the most powerful techniques to face this problem, their strengths and weaknesses have typically been discussed based only on the class imbalance ratio. However, several questions remain open and need further exploration. For instance, the subtle differences in performance between the over- and under-sampling algorithms are still under-comprehended, and we hypothesize that they could be better explained by analyzing the inner structure of the data sets. Consequently, this paper attempts to investigate and illustrate the effects of the resampling methods on the inner structure of a data set by exploiting local neighborhood information, identifying the sample types in both classes and analyzing their distribution in each resampled set. Experimental results indicate that the resampling methods that produce the highest proportion of safe samples and the lowest proportion of unsafe samples correspond to those with the highest overall performance. The significance of this paper lies in the fact that our findings may contribute to gain a better understanding of how these techniques perform on class-imbalanced data and why over-sampling has been reported to be usually more efficient than under-sampling. The outcomes in this study may have impact on both research and practice in the design of expert and intelligent systems since a priori knowledge about the internal structure of the imbalanced data sets could be incorporated to the learning algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Class imbalance; Local neighborhood; Resampling; Sample types","Elsevier Ltd"

To promote the air pollution prediction performance, an innovative air pollution forecasting model is proposed based on class imbalance semi-supervised extreme learning machine (SS-ELM). First, majority weighted minority oversampling technique (MWMOTE), was employed to construct the balanced dataset. After preprocessing, SS-ELM is then selected to establish the model for classification and predict the air pollution level.

Previous studies focused on defining Machine-Learning models to predict defect-prone blueprints using supervised binary classification. This class of techniques uses both defective and non-defective instances in the training phase. Furthermore, the high imbalance between defective and non-defective samples makes the training more difficult and leads to unreliable classifiers. In this work, we tackle the defect-prediction problem from a different perspective using novelty detection and evaluate the performance of three techniques, namely OneClassSVM, LocalOutlierFactor, and IsolationForest, and compare their performance with a baseline RandomForest binary classifier. Such models are trained using only non-defective samples: defective data points are treated as novelty because the number of defective samples is too little compared to defective ones. We conduct an empirical study on an extremely-imbalanced dataset consisting of 85 real-world Ansible projects containing only small amounts of defective instances. We found that novelty detection techniques can recognize defects with a high level of precision and recall, an AUC-PR up to 0.86, and an MCC up to 0.31.

Several studies and various attempts were made in the past to overcome this imbalance problem which is a serious issue to the standard machine learning techniques especially classification and regression but, still there exists a need to handle the imbalance problem effectively. Datasets which are imbalanced generally include safe and unsafe minority samples. Our proposed approach is a classifier independent two tier iterative ensemble approach which focuses the rare minority sample's influence on learning from imbalanced datasets. Most of the informed oversampling techniques like SMOTE and its variants cannot be applied directly on rare class samples especially when the count of rare samples is too low. To alleviate this problem, in our proposed approach to learn from rare and outlying samples we proposed a hybrid oversampling technique used at different levels and make them balanced. The goal is to tone down the data imbalance at the data preprocessing stage itself by correcting or balancing the training data sets before moving to the learning part which makes the classifier to focus on its primary role and thereby it improves the learning process. The proposed two tier iterative ensemble approach shows a much significant improvement in the learning process among the multiclass imbalanced data which is clearly evident with the experimental results. © 2020 IEEE.","majority class; minority class; Multiclass Data imbalance; RandomOversampling; SMOTE; Z-Score","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Imbalanced learning can lead to a reduction in classification accuracy and even the omission of the minority class. In this paper, an impartial semi-supervised learning strategy based on extreme gradient boosting (ISS-XGB) is proposed to classify very high resolution (VHR) images with imbalanced data. ISS-XGB solves multi-class classification by using several semi-supervised classifiers. It first employs multi-group unlabeled data to eliminate the imbalance of training samples and then utilizes gradient boosting-based regression to simulate the target classes with positive and unlabeled samples. In this study, experiments were conducted on eight study areas with different imbalanced situations. The results showed that ISS-XGB provided a comparable but more stable performance than most commonly used classification approaches (i.e., random forest (RF), XGB, multilayer perceptron (MLP), and support vector machine (SVM)), positive and unlabeled learning (PU-Learning) methods (PU-BP and PU-SVM), and typical synthetic sample-based imbalanced learning methods. Especially under extremely imbalanced situations, ISS-XGB can provide high accuracy for the minority class without losing overall performance (the average overall accuracy achieves 85.92%). The proposed strategy has great potential in solving the imbalanced classification problems in remote sensing. © 2020 by the authors.

Phishing attacks have the potential to be similar in different regions, perhaps at different times. We have developed a novel semi-supervised machine learning algorithm, which we call Pelican, that detects potential phishing attacks in real-time on Twitter. Pelican can be used for early detection of potential phishing attacks and is able to detect potential new attacks without pre-existing assumptions about the type of data or understanding of the characteristics of the attacks. The technique uses ensembles and sampling methods to handle class imbalances in real-world applications. The technique continuously detects unusual behaviour or changes in Twitter. We have investigated changes in trends across Twitter to detect changes in online behaviour of potential phishing links. The technique uses a change detector that enables automatic retraining when there is unusual behaviour detected.

CVD is associated with worsening of renal functions. But patients with CVD remains often underdiagnosed and undertreated for CKD because mostly the clinical diagnosis and treatment are single organ centered in earlier stages. Machine learning algorithms have been widely used to predict and classify diseases in healthcare. Healthcare data is often imbalanced. In this analysis, the CKD prediction model is built using CVD data with imbalanced distribution of positive and negative cases. The analysis involves three stages: Stage I involves selecting the best model based on performance metrics that support imbalanced class distribution without applying any resampling techniques. Stage II involves oversampling the training data of the minority class using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) and stage III involves randomly under-sampling the training data of the majority class to solve the class imbalance. The experimental results show that the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron)-SMOTE model performs better in predicting CKD with a better F-score, recall, precision, G-mean, balanced accuracy and RUC-AUC when compared to other models. © 2020, Engg Journals Publications.

However, established methods often provide modest improvements in classification performance when applied to data with extremely imbalanced class distribution and to mixed-type data. This is usual for vital statistics data, in which the outcome incidence dictates the amount of positive observations. In this article, we developed a novel neural network-based oversampling method called actGAN (activation-specific generative adversarial network) that can derive useful synthetic observations in terms of increasing prediction performance in this context. Materials and Methods: From vital statistics data, the outcome of early stillbirth was chosen to be predicted based on demographics, pregnancy history, and infections. The data contained 363 560 live births and 139 early stillbirths, resulting in class imbalance of 99.96% and 0.04%. The hyperparameters of actGAN and a baseline method SMOTE-NC (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique-Nominal Continuous) were tuned with Bayesian optimization, and both were compared against a cost-sensitive learning-only approach. Results: While SMOTE-NC provided mixed results, actGAN was able to improve true positive rate at a clinically significant false positive rate and area under the curve from the receiver-operating characteristic curve consistently. Discussion: Including an activation-specific output layer to a generator network of actGAN enables the addition of information about the underlying data structure, which overperforms the nominal mechanism of SMOTE-NC. Conclusions: actGAN provides an improvement to the prediction performance for our learning task. Our developed method could be applied to other mixed-type data prediction tasks that are known to be afflicted by class imbalance and limited data availability. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Manual mining of these information from biomedical literature is costly and time-consuming. To address these issues, various researches have been carried out to design an efficient automatic tool. In this paper, we propose a multi-view based deep neural network model for CDR task. Typically, multiple representations (or views) of the datasets are not available for this task. So, we train multiple conceptually different deep neural network models on the dataset to generate different abstract features, treated as different views. A novel loss function, 'Penalized LF', is defined to address the problem of imbalance dataset. The proposed loss function is generic in nature. The model is designed as a combination of Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network along with a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). To show the efficacy of our proposed model, we have compared it with six baseline models and other state-of-the-art techniques, on 'chemicals-and-disease-DFE' dataset, a free text dataset created by Li et al. from BioCreative V Chemical Disease Relation dataset. Results show that the proposed model attains highest F1-score for individual classes, proving its efficiency in handling class imbalance problem in the dataset. To further demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model, we have presented results on BioCreative V dataset and two Protein-Protein Interaction Identification (PPI) datasets, viz., AiMed and BioInfer. All these results are also compared with the state-of-the-art models. © 2013 IEEE.","chemical-disease relations; imbalanced class; Multi-view classification; relation extraction; text mining","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Such performance is further hindered by class imbalance; datasets where a diagnosis is much more common than others. To overcome these two issues at low-cost while preserving privacy, data augmentation methods can be employed. In the time domain, the traditional method of time-warping could alter the underlying data distribution with detrimental consequences. This is prominent when dealing with physiological conditions that influence the frequency components of data. In this paper, we propose PlethAugment; three different conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) with an adapted diversity term for the generation of pathological photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals in order to boost medical classification performance. To evaluate and compare the GANs, we introduce a novel metric-agnostic method; the synthetic generalization curve. We validate this approach on two proprietary and two public datasets representing a diverse set of medical conditions. Compared to training on non-augmented class-balanced datasets, training on augmented datasets leads to an improvement of the AUROC by up to 29% when using cross validation. This illustrates the potential of the proposed CGANs to significantly improve classification performance. © 2013 IEEE.","Conditional generative adversarial networks; data-augmentation; low-resource; photople-thysmogram; time-series","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Typically, a high-resolution remote sensing image has the characteristics of high spatial resolution and low spectral resolution, complex large-scale land covers, small class differences for some land covers, vague foreground, and imbalanced distribution of samples. However, traditional machine learning algorithms have limitations in deep image feature extraction and dealing with sample imbalance issue. In the paper, we proposed an improved full-convolution neural network, called DeepLab V3+, with loss function based solution of samples imbalance. In addition, we select Sentinel-2 remote sensing images covering the Yuli County, Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China as data sources, then a typical region image dataset is built by data augmentation. The experimental results show that the improved DeepLab V3+ model can not only utilize the spectral information of high-resolution remote sensing images, but also consider its rich spatial information. The classification accuracy of the proposed method on the test dataset reaches 97.97%. The mean Intersection-over-Union reaches 87.74%, and the Kappa coefficient 0.9587.

Although machine learning algorithms are most likely successful in LC mapping tasks, the class imbalance problem is known as a common challenge in this regard. This problem occurs during the training phase and reduces classification accuracy for infrequent and rare LC classes. To address this issue, this study proposes a new method by integrating random under-sampling of majority classes and an ensemble of Support Vector Machines, namely Random Under-sampling Ensemble of Support Vector Machines (RUESVMs). The performance of RUESVMs for LC classification was evaluated in Google Earth Engine (GEE) over two different case studies using Sentinel-2 time-series data and five well-known spectral indices, including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (GNDVI), Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), and Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). The performance of RUESVMs was also compared with the traditional SVM and combination of SVM with three benchmark data balancing techniques namely the Random Over-Sampling (ROS), Random Under-Sampling (RUS), and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). It was observed that the proposed method considerably improved the accuracy of LC classification, especially for the minority classes. After adopting RUESVMs, the overall accuracy of the generated LC map increased by approximately 4.95 percentage points, and this amount for the geometric mean of producer’s accuracies was almost 3.75 percentage points, in comparison to the most accurate data balancing method (i.e., SVM-SMOTE). Regarding the geometric mean of users’ accuracies, RUESVMs also outperformed the SVM-SMOTE method with an average increase of 6.45 percentage points. © 2020 by the authors.

However, due to the complexity and particularity of the fMRI task, it is difficult to find enough subjects, resulting in a small and, often, imbalanced dataset. A dataset with small samples causes overfitting of the learning model, and the imbalance will make the model insensitive to the minority class, which has been a problem in classification. It is of great significance to classify fMRI data with small and imbalanced samples. In the present study, we propose a 3-step method on a small and imbalanced fMRI dataset from a word-scene memory task. The steps of the method are as follows: (1) An independent component analysis is performed to reduce the dimension of data; (2) The synthetic minority oversampling technique is used to generate new samples of the minority class to balance data; (3) A convolution-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network is used to classify the independent component signals, indicating whether the subjects are performing episodic memory tasks. The accuracy of the proposed method is 72.2%, which improves the classification performance compared with traditional classifiers such as support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LGR), linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN), and this study gives a biomarker for evaluating the reactivation of episodic memory. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper proposes a framework for developing a Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) that addresses class imbalance and the feature selection problem. Under this framework, the dataset is balanced at the data level and a wrapper approach is used to perform feature selection. The following three clinical datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository were used for experimentation: the Indian Liver Patient Dataset (ILPD), the Thoracic Surgery Dataset (TSD) and the Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset. The Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), which was enhanced using Orchard's algorithm, was used to balance the datasets. A wrapper approach that uses Chaotic Multi-Verse Optimisation (CMVO) was proposed for feature subset selection. The arithmetic mean of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) and F-score (F1), which was measured using a Random Forest (RF) classifier, was used as the fitness function. After selecting the relevant features, a RF, which comprises 100 estimators and uses the Information Gain Ratio as the split criteria, was used for classification. The classifier achieved a 0.65 MCC, a 0.84 F1 and 82.46% accuracy for the ILPD; a 0.74 MCC, a 0.87 F1 and 86.88% accuracy for the TSD; and a 0.78 MCC, a 0.89 F1and 89.04% accuracy for the PID dataset. The effects of balancing and feature selection on the classifier were investigated and the performance of the framework was compared with the existing works in the literature. The results showed that the proposed framework is competitive in terms of the three performance measures used. The results of a Wilcoxon test confirmed the statistical superiority of the proposed method. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chaotic maps; Class imbalance; Classification; Clinical decision support system; Feature selection; Multi Verse Optimisation; SMOTE","Elsevier Ltd"

However, one of the major challenges in machine learning-based intrusion detection methods is how to include enough training examples for all the possible classes in the model to avoid the class imbalance problem and accurately detect the intrusions and their types. in this article, we propose a novel weighted classes classification scheme to secure the network against malicious nodes while alleviating the problem of imbalanced data. in the proposed system, we combine a supervised machine learning algorithm with the network node past information and a specific designed best effort iterative algorithm to enhance the accuracy of rarely detectable attacks. The machine learning algorithm is used to generate a classifier that differentiates between the investigated attacks. The system stores these decisions in a private database. Then, we design a new weight optimization algorithm that exploits these decisions to generate a weights vector that includes the best weight for each class. The proposed model enhances the overall detection accuracy and maximizes the number of correctly detectable classes even for the classes with a relatively low number of training entries.

Many conventional methods addressed this problem by extracting connected components (CCs) and classifying the extracted CCs into two classes. They were based on the assumption that two types of components are not overlapping each other, while we are focusing on more challenging and realistic cases where the components are often overlapping each other. For this, we propose a new method that performs pixel-level classification with a convolutional neural network. Unlike conventional neural network methods, our method works in an end-to-end manner and does not require any preprocessing steps (e.g., foreground extraction, handcrafted feature extraction, and so on). For the training of our network, we develop a cross-entropy based loss function to alleviate the class imbalance problem. Regarding the training dataset, although there are some datasets of mixed printed characters and handwritten scripts, most of them do not have overlapping cases and do not provide pixel-level annotations. Hence, we also propose a data synthesis method that generates realistic pixel-level training samples having many overlappings of printed and handwritten components. Experimental results on synthetic and real images have shown the effectiveness of the proposed method. Although the proposed network has been trained only with synthetic images, it also improves the OCR rate of real documents. Specifically, the OCR rate for machine-printed texts is increased from 0.8087 to 0.9442 by removing the overlapped handwritten scribbles by our method. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Class imbalance problem; Data synthesis; Handwritten text segmentation; Optical character recognition; Text separation","Springer"

Imbalanced datasets would cause the performance degradation of a classifier by utilizing imbalanced learning, which tends to overfocus on the majority class. In this paper, we consider an imbalanced neuroimaging classification problem, namely, classification of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Methods: We propose a multi-objective classification scheme based on support vector machine (SVM). Our scheme addresses the imbalanced dataset problem by using a three objective SVM model with the positive and negative empirical errors being handled explicitly and separately. Moreover, an interactive multi-objective method incorporating the decision maker's preference is adopted, thus a preferred subset of pareto optimal classifiers for decision making can be obtained. Results: The proposed scheme is assessed on five datasets from the ADHD- 200 consortium. Numerical results show that the proposed multi-objective scheme considerably outperforms some traditional classification methods in the literature. Conclusion: The proposed multi-objective classification scheme avoids hyper-parameter selection, it effectively addresses dataset imbalanced problem from algorithm level. The scheme can not only be used in the diagnosis of ADHD but also in the diagnosis of other diseases, such as Alzheimer and Autism etc. © 2020","ADHD; fMRI; Multi-objective optimization; SVM","Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

The accurate identification of lithological and fluid-bearing zones is a limiting factor for exploring such reservoirs effectively. Log data, which provide abundant and high precision geological information, are always used for this task. Here, we combined a deep neural network with an oversampling approach named MAHAKIL for lithology and fluid identification using log data from a tight sandstone gas reservoir. MAHAKIL was adopted to solve the class imbalance problem resulting from imbalanced training samples, and the outputs were then fed into a deep neural network to learn the complex and abstract geological patterns related to the lithology and fluid in a layer-by-layer manner. We first demonstrated the unsatisfactory performance of a typical classification algorithm on a simulated data which conforms to the normal distribution and is imbalanced. Then, the performance of our method was compared with that of a support vector machine and a deep neural network on the imbalanced actual data, and the Fβ score which is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall was used as the evaluation criterion.

In this study, we investigated the impact of re-sampling techniques for imbalanced datasets in PET radiomics-based prognostication model in head and neck (HNC) cancer patients. Methods: Radiomics analysis was performed in two cohorts of patients, including 166 patients newly diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in our centre and 182 HNC patients from open database. Conventional PET parameters and robust radiomics features were extracted for correlation analysis of the overall survival (OS) and disease progression-free survival (DFS). We investigated a cross-combination of 10 re-sampling methods (oversampling, undersampling, and hybrid sampling) with 4 machine learning classifiers for survival prediction. Diagnostic performance was assessed in hold-out test sets. Statistical differences were analysed using Monte Carlo cross-validations by post hoc Nemenyi analysis. Results: Oversampling techniques like ADASYN and SMOTE could improve prediction performance in terms of G-mean and F-measures in minority class, without significant loss of F-measures in majority class. We identified optimal PET radiomics-based prediction model of OS (AUC of 0.82, G-mean of 0.77) for our NPC cohort. Similar findings that oversampling techniques improved the prediction performance were seen when this was tested on an external dataset indicating generalisability. Conclusion: Our study showed a significant positive impact on the prediction performance in imbalanced datasets by applying re-sampling techniques. We have created an open-source solution for automated calculations and comparisons of multiple re-sampling techniques and machine learning classifiers for easy replication in future studies. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","18F-FDG PET; Head and neck cancer; Imbalanced datasets; Radiomics; Re-sampling techniques","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

One of the most important challenges is the learning in imbalanced datasets. The imbalanced data generally refers to a classification problem where the number of data samples per class is not equally distributed. Typically there is a large amount of data for one class (referred to as the majority class) and much fewer data for the other class (referred to as the minority class). In such datasets, learning algorithms are biased toward learning the majority class to reach better accuracy, which leads to the lack of learning in minority class data. This article first introduces a method called neighbor competition scoring (NCS) for assigning scores to samples. Each data point is assigned a lower score if it is farther away from its class samples or closer to the samples of other classes. Then, with the help of these scores, neighbor competition undersampling (NCU) method is presented for undersampling the majority class samples that are less important than other samples. The proposed method has been compared with some popular data-based methods in 10 datasets and has performed better according to the experiments. © 2020 IEEE.","balancing dataset; imbalance datasets; imbalance learning; k-nearest neighbors; under-sampling","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The preferred diagnostic procedure at the acute stage is the acquisition of multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This type of imaging not only detects and locates the stroke lesion, but also provides the blood flow dynamics that helps clinicians in assessing the risks and benefits of reperfusion therapies. However, evaluating the outcome of these risky therapies beforehand is a complicated task due to the variability of lesion location, size, shape, and cerebral hemodynamics involved. Though the fully automated model for predicting treatment outcomes using multi-parametric imaging would be highly valuable in clinical settings, MRI datasets acquired at the acute stage are mostly scarce and suffer high class imbalance. In this paper, parallel multi-parametric feature embedded siamese network (PMFE-SN) is proposed that can learn with few samples and can handle skewness in multi-parametric MRI data. Moreover, five suitable evaluation metrics that are insensitive to imbalance are defined for this problem. The results show that PMFE-SN not only outperforms other state-of-the-art techniques in all these metrics but also can predict the class with a small number of samples, as well as the class with high number of samples. An accuracy of 0.67 on leave one cross out testing has been achieved with only two samples (minority class) for training and accuracy of 0.61 with the highest number of samples (majority class). In comparison, state-of-the-art using hand crafted features has 0 accuracy for minority class and 0.33 accuracy for majority class. © 2020 by the authors.","Acute ischemic stroke; Deep learning; Feature embedding; Imbalance; Machine learning; Multi-parametric MRI; Siamese network","MDPI AG"

Hence, this paradigm is capable of comprehending the categories that were never seen before. While deep learning has pushed the limits of unseen object recognition, ZSL for temporal problems such as unfamiliar gesture recognition (referred to as ZSGL) remain unexplored. ZSGL has the potential to result in efficient human-machine interfaces that can recognize and understand the spontaneous and conversational gestures of humans. In this regard, the objective of this work is to conceptualize, model and develop a framework to tackle ZSGL problems. The first step in the pipeline is to develop a database of gesture attributes that are representative of a range of categories. Next, a deep architecture consisting of convolutional and recurrent layers is proposed to jointly optimize the semantic and classification losses. Lastly, rigorous experiments are performed to compare the proposed model with respect to existing ZSL models on CGD 2013 and MSRC-12 datasets. In our preliminary work, we identified a list of 64 discriminative attributes related to gestures' morphological characteristics. Our approach yields an unseen class accuracy of (41%) which outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches by a considerable margin. Future work involves the following: 1. Modifying the existing architecture in order to improve the ZSL accuracy, 2. Augmenting the database of attributes to incorporate semantic properties, 3.

It has received significant attention in the machine learning and data mining community. This problem is present in fraud detection, medical diagnostics, and a number of other areas where training data contains significantly more representatives of one class (called the majority class) than the other class (called the minority class). Machine learning techniques struggle to deal with imbalanced data by focusing on minimizing the error rate for the majority class while ignoring the minority class, which is the most interesting from a learning point of view and also involves a high cost when it is not well classified. However, the imbalance ratio is not the only cause of poor performance when learning from imbalanced data. Another critical factor that accompanies imbalanced data in the real world is the presence of a number of instances of the two classes being overlapped in feature space. This problem is commonly referred to as class overlap and we have called it 'behavioral noise'. In this paper, we propose One Side Behavioral Noise Reduction (OSBNR) approach to deal with the problem of class imbalance in the presence of a behavioral noise level. OSBNR is based on two stages. Firstly, a clustering is applied to groups similar instances of the minority class in multiple behavior clusters. Secondly, we select and eliminate instances of the majority class, considered as behavioral noise, which overlap with the behavior clusters of the minority class. The results of experiments conducted on a representative public dataset confirm that the proposed approach is effective for class imbalance problem in the presence of behavioral noise. © 2020 IEEE.","Class imbalance; Class overlapping; Data mining; Fraud detection; Machine learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

A/V classification methods based on traditional machine learning require complicated feature engineering, consistently rely on the results of blood vessel extraction, and cannot achieve end-to-end A/V classification. The development of deep semantic segmentation technology makes end-to-end A/V classification possible, and has been commonly used in fundus image analysis. In this paper, a segmentation model semantic fusion based U-Net (SFU-Net) is proposed combined with the powerful feature extraction capabilities of deep learning to improve the accuracy of A/V classification. Method: First, the arteries and veins in the fundus image belong to blood vessels and are highly similar in structure. Existing deep learning-based A/V classification methods frequently treat this problem as a multiclassification problem. This paper proposes a multilabel learning strategy to address this problem for reducing the difficulty of optimization and deal with the situation where the arteries and veins in the fundus image cross. The lower layers of the network are mainly responsible for extracting the common features of the two structures. The upper layers of the network learn two binary classifiers and extract the arteries and veins independently. Second, considering the high similarity of the description features of arteries and veins in color and structure, this paper improves the U-Net architecture in two aspects. 1) The original simple feature extractor of U-Net is replaced by DenseNet-121. The original U-Net encoder is composed of 10 convolutional layers and four maximum pooling layers, and the feature extraction capability is extremely limited. By contrast, DenseNet-121 has many convolutional layers, and the introduction of dense connections makes the feature utilization rate high, the transmission efficiency of features and gradients in the network is high, and the feature extraction ability is strong. This paper reduces four downsampling operations of U-Net to three, and the input image is downsampled by eight times to avoid the loss of detailed information. 2) A semantic fusion module is proposed. The semantic fusion module includes two operations, namely, feature fusion and channelwise attention mechanism. Low-level features have high resolution and contain many location and detail information, but few semantic features and many noises. High-level features have strong semantic information, but their resolution is extremely low and the detail information is few. The features from different layers are first fused to enhance their distinguishing ability. For the fused features, the channelwise attention mechanism is used to select the features. The convolution filter can only capture local information. The global average pooling operation is performed on the input features in the channel dimension to capture global context information. Each element of the resulting vector is a concentrated representation of its corresponding channel. Two nonlinear transformations are then performed on the vector to model the correlation between channels and reduce the amount of parameters and calculations. The vector is restored to its original dimension and normalized to 0-1 through the sigmoid gate. Each element in the obtained vector is regarded as the importance of each channel in the input feature, and each feature channel of the input feature is weighted through a multiplication operation. Through the channel attention mechanism, the network can automatically focus on the feature channels that are important to the task while suppressing the features that are unimportant, thereby improving the performance of the model during the training process. Third, considering the problem of uneven distribution between blood vessels and background pixels in the fundus image, this paper takes focal loss as the loss function to solve the problem of class imbalance and focus on difficult samples at the same time. Focal loss introduces parameters α and γ in the cross-entropy loss function. Parameter α is used to balance the difference between positive and negative samples. Parameter γ adjusts the degree where the loss of simple samples is reduced, thereby amplifying the difference between the loss values of difficult and simple samples. The values of the two parameters are determined through cross-validation. The overall optimization goal is the sum of the focal loss of arteries and veins, thereby optimizing the arteries and veins during training. Result: The proposed method is verified on two public datasets, namely, digital retinal images for vessel extraction(DRIVE) and WIDE, and its performance is evaluated from two perspectives, namely, segmentation and classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method shows better performance than most existing methods. The proposed method achieves an area under the curve of 0.968 6 and 0.973 6 for segmenting arteries and veins on the DRIVE dataset, and the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and balanced-accuracy of A/V classification are 88.39%, 94.25%, 91.68%, and 91.32%, respectively. Compared with state-of-the-art method, the sensitivity of the proposed method only decreases by 0.61%, and specificity, accuracy, and balaned-auuracy have absolute improvements of 4.25%, 2.68%, and 1.82%, respectively. The proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.38%, which is 6.18% higher than the state-of-the-art method. Conclusion: The fusion module can effectively use multi-scale features and automatically select many important features, thereby improving performance. The proposed method performs well in A/V classification, exceeding most existing methods. © 2020, Editorial and Publishing Board of Journal of Image and Graphics.

In this paper, we propose a machine learning method of detecting fraudulent claims. The proposed method uses the adaptive synthetic sampling method (ADASYN) to remove imbalances in the dataset. We then used Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the claim cases. The outcome of the algorithm is compared to the imbalanced datasets and other existing methods. © 2020 IEEE.","class-imbalances; fraudulent-claims; Support Vector Machines","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The further improvements of predictability require the systemic analysis of crash likelihood within the driver–vehicle–environment triptych. This study presents a proactive decision support system that can predict crash events based on vehicle kinematics, driver inputs, roadway geometric features and real-time weather data. Modeling approaches that rely on Random forest, Support Vector Machine and Multilayer Perceptron machine learning techniques were applied to establish efficient crash predictions. Moreover, crash events are generally unexpected and occur rarely, thus classification results can yield deceivingly high prediction performance which are usually driven by the majority class at the expense of having poor performance on the crucial minority class. Therefore, this paper attempts to add to the current knowledge by investigating crash likelihood based on compared different data balancing techniques to improve the predictive performance through three balancing techniques: over-sampling, under-sampling and synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE). The highest performances have been acquired using SMOTE strategy as MLP achieved a 94.5% precision, 94.2% f1-score, 93.7% AUC and 95.3% recall, while SVM achieved a 91.5% g-mean. Furthermore, results indicated that more than 62% of total crashes have been reported in downhills and curved downhills, and 44% of all crash instances have been reported during both snow and rain weather patterns.

This means machine learning-driven fault diagnosis methods have to learn from imbalanced data, and accordingly lead to lower diagnostic accuracy or even directly errors in identifying minority class. To solve this problem, we present a novel Minority-class Sensitive Fault Diagnosis approach (MSFD), which can reduce the imbalance of data and enhance the sensitivity of our diagnostic model to minority-class samples. Specifically, we first design a new generative oversampling method by combining Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to balance the whole dataset and improve the distribution of the minority-class samples. WGAN is adopted to learn the distribution of minority-class samples and generate some minority-class samples as a supplement to the original dataset, while SMOTE is applied to the resulting dataset to further enhance the diversity of synthetic samples for weakening the influence from WGAN's mode collapse. In addition, a deep forest or multi-Grained Cascade Forest (GcForest) based minority-class aware fault classification model is developed. First, during multi-grained scanning processes, we score the forests and select the corresponding forests with higher scores to generate feature representations for accelerating model convergence. Second, weights are introduced for different forests in cascade levels to further improve the overall performance of our fault diagnostic model. A series of experiments are conducted to testify the effectiveness of our proposed method, and the experimental results show that our approach can synthesize new minority-class samples with higher qualities and improve the diagnosis performance for minority-class samples as well as its overall classification accuracy. Meanwhile, in case of extremely imbalanced datasets, the proposed approach still maintains a relatively high recognition rate for minority-class samples. © 2020 IEEE.","Data imbalance; Deep forest; Fault diagnosis; Generative adversarial network; SMOTE","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

It builds upon the recently introduced xDNN method addressing more complex multi-class problems, specifically when classes are highly imbalanced. DMR moves away from a direct decision based on all classes towards a layered DT of pair-wise class comparisons. In addition, it forces the prototypes to be balanced between classes regardless of possible class imbalances of the training data. It has two novel mechanisms, namely i) using a DT to determine the winning class label, and ii) balancing the classes by synthesizing data around the prototypes determined from the available training data. As a result, we improved significantly the performance of the resulting fully explainable DNN as evidenced on the well know benchmark problem Caltech-101. Furthermore, we also achieved high results in terms of accuracy for the well known Caltech-256 dataset, as well as surpassed the results of other approaches on Faces-1999 problem. In summary, we propose a new approach specifically advantageous for imbalanced multi-class problems on well known hard benchmark datasets.

Consequently, researchers resort to suboptimal datasets that no longer relate to a real-world network nor provide insights for current network issues, such as the DARPA'98 dataset and its variants KDD'99 and NSL-KDD. In this article, we propose a statistical study over the NSL-KDD features, and we conclude that NSL-KDD and the old KDD'99 should not be used as a benchmark for creating novel anomaly-based approaches intrusion detection systems because they introduce a biased classification, since features are over-correlated. The proposed approach analyzes the correlation among features instead of checking for redundant values or the imbalance of data. Our results align with the performance of three machine learning techniques trained to discriminate attack from normal traffic. We show that biased classification occurs because there was a high correlation between features and classes. The syntactically-generated features are statistically different between normal and attack traffic classes, which implies that, in KDD-related datasets, attackers are not stealthy. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Although standard Machine Learning (ML) classifiers can achieve high accuracies for majority classes, they largely fail to provide reasonable accuracies for minority classes. This is mainly due to the class imbalance problem. In this study, a hybrid data balancing method, called the Partial Random Over-Sampling and Random Under-Sampling (PROSRUS), was proposed to resolve the class imbalance issue. Unlike most data balancing techniques which seek to fully balance datasets, PROSRUS uses a partial balancing approach with hundreds of fractions for majority and minority classes to balance datasets. For this, time-series of Landsat-8 and SRTM topographic data along with various spectral indices and topographic data were used over three mountainous sites within the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud platform. It was observed that PROSRUS had better performance than several other balancing methods and increased the accuracy of minority classes without a reduction in overall classification accuracy. Furthermore, adopting complementary information, particularly topographic data, considerably increased the accuracy of minority classes in mountainous areas. Finally, the obtained results from PROSRUS indicated that every imbalanced dataset requires a specific fraction(s) for addressing the class imbalance problem, because different datasets contain various characteristics. © 2020 by the authors.

As the large amount of data presents the nature of imbalance, the study of active learning methods for corresponding unbalanced datasets highlights important practical significance. There is a problem with the current algorithm. The initialization of active learning becomes difficult with the increase of the unbalanced degree, which causes more labels waste. This paper proposes a one-class support vector machine active learning (OCSVM-AL) method for this problem. Firstly, we obtain the structure information of the sample set by k-means clustering. Then, the OCSVM-AL is used on each cluster. For each cluster, OCSVM-AL iteratively marks the sample from the cluster and adds the marked sample to the marked sample pool. A one-class support vector machine model is trained by using majority class samples in the marked sample pool. The trained model is used to predict the unlabeled samples in this cluster, and the labels of unlabeled samples is obtained. By the results of each cluster, all sample labels are obtained. Simulation experiments proved that this method is an effective active learning method and can significantly reduce the labeled sample size. © 2020 IEEE.","Active Learning; K-means Clustering; One-Class Support Vector Machine(OCSVM); Unbalanced Dataset","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

In order to discover and remove ARBs, ARB prediction is proposed. However, due to the low presence and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, it is usually difficult to collect sufficient ARB data within a project. Therefore, cross-project ARB prediction is proposed as a solution to build the target project's ARB predictor by using the labeled data from the source project. A key point for cross-project ARB prediction is to reduce distribution difference between source and target project. However, existing approaches mainly focus on the marginal distribution difference while somehow overlook the conditional distribution difference, and they mainly use random oversampling to alleviate the class imbalance which may lead to overfitting. To address these problems, we propose a new crossproject ARB prediction approach based on Joint Distribution Adaptation (JDA) and Improved Subclass Discriminant Analysis (ISDA), called JDA-ISDA. The key idea of JDA-ISDA is first to use JDA to reduce the marginal distribution and conditional distribution difference jointly and then apply ISDA to alleviate the severe class imbalance problem. A set of experiments are carried out on two large open-source projects with six different machine learning (ML) classifiers. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the stateof- the-art Transfer Learning based Aging-related bug Prediction (TLAP) and Supervised Representation Learning Approach (SRLA), JDA-ISDA is much more robust to different ML classifiers than TLAP, and the average improvement in terms of the balance value can be achieved up to 31.8%, and JDA-ISDA also outperforms TLAP and SRLA on average when logistic regression is chosen as the classifier for best performance prediction. ©2020 IEEE.","Aging-related bugs; Cross-project ARB prediction; Improved subclass discriminant analysis; Joint distribution adaptation; Software aging","IEEE Computer Society"

To solve it, two algorithms are developed from the dual and primal spaces, respectively, thus yielding DKELM- CIL and P-KELM-CIL. However, both D-KELM-CIL and P-KELM-CIL are not sparse algorithms. Hence, a sparse strategy based on Cholesky factorization is utilized to realize their sparseness, producing CD-KELM-CIL and CP-KELM-CIL.

An accurate Electricity Theft Detection (ETD) is quite challenging due to the inaccurate classification on the imbalance electricity consumption data, the overfitting issues and the High False Positive Rate (FPR) of the existing techniques. Therefore, intensified research is needed to accurately detect the electricity thieves and to recover a huge revenue loss for utility companies. To address the above limitations, this paper presents a new model, which is based on the supervised machine learning techniques and real electricity consumption data. Initially, the electricity data are pre-processed using interpolation, three sigma rule and normalization methods. Since the distribution of labels in the electricity consumption data is imbalanced, an Adasyn algorithm is utilized to address this class imbalance problem. It is used to achieve two objectives. Firstly, it intelligently increases the minority class samples in the data. Secondly, it prevents the model from being biased towards the majority class samples. Afterwards, the balanced data are fed into a Visual Geometry Group (VGG-16) module to detect abnormal patterns in electricity consumption. Finally, a Firefly Algorithm based Extreme Gradient Boosting (FA-XGBoost) technique is exploited for classification. The simulations are conducted to show the performance of our proposed model. Moreover, the state-of-the-art methods are also implemented for comparative analysis, i.e., Support Vector Machine (SVM), Convolution Neural Network (CNN), and Logistic Regression (LR). For validation, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Receiving Operating Characteristics Area Under Curve (ROC-AUC), and Precision Recall Area Under Curve (PR-AUC) metrics are used. Firstly, the simulation results show that the proposed Adasyn method has improved the performance of FA-XGboost classifier, which has achieved F1-score, precision, and recall of 93.7%, 92.6%, and 97%, respectively. Secondly, the VGG-16 module achieved a higher generalized performance by securing accuracy of 87.2% and 83.5% on training and testing data, respectively. Thirdly, the proposed FA-XGBoost has correctly identified actual electricity thieves, i.e., recall of 97%. Moreover, our model is superior to the other state-of-the-art models in terms of handling the large time series data and accurate classification. These models can be efficiently applied by the utility companies using the real electricity consumption data to identify the electricity thieves and overcome the major revenue losses in power sector. © 2020 by the authors.

Timely diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial both for disease control and patient care. Non-contrast thoracic computed tomography (CT) has been identified as an effective tool for the diagnosis, yet the disease outbreak has placed tremendous pressure on radiologists for reading the exams and may potentially lead to fatigue-related mis-diagnosis. Reliable automatic classification algorithms can be really helpful; however, they usually require a considerable number of COVID-19 cases for training, which is difficult to acquire in a timely manner. Meanwhile, how to effectively utilize the existing archive of non-COVID-19 data (the negative samples) in the presence of severe class imbalance is another challenge. In addition, the sudden disease outbreak necessitates fast algorithm development. In this work, we propose a novel approach for effective and efficient training of COVID-19 classification networks using a small number of COVID-19 CT exams and an archive of negative samples. Concretely, a novel self-supervised learning method is proposed to extract features from the COVID-19 and negative samples. Then, two kinds of soft-labels ('difficulty' and 'diversity') are generated for the negative samples by computing the earth mover's distances between the features of the negative and COVID-19 samples, from which data 'values' of the negative samples can be assessed. A pre-set number of negative samples are selected accordingly and fed to the neural network for training. Experimental results show that our approach can achieve superior performance using about half of the negative samples, substantially reducing model training time. © 2013 IEEE.","Coronavirus disease 2019; efficient network training; Self-supervised learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Patients undergoing surgical resection and histopathological assessment of renal tumors at a tertiary referral center between 2012 and 2019 were included. Preoperative venous-phase CTs from multiple referring imaging centers were segmented, and standardized radiomic features extracted. After preprocessing, class imbalance handling, and feature selection, machine learning algorithms were used to predict renal tumor subtypes using 10-fold cross validation, assessed as multiclass area under the curve (AUC). In total, n = 201 patients were included (73.7% male; mean age 66 ± 11 years), with n = 131 clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC), n = 29 papillary RCC, n = 11 chromophobe RCC, n = 16 oncocytomas, and n = 14 angiomyolipomas (AML). An extreme gradient boosting algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy (multiclass area under the curve (AUC) = 0.72). The worst discrimination was evident for oncocytomas vs. AML and oncocytomas vs. chromophobe RCC (AUC = 0.55 and AUC = 0.45, respectively). In sensitivity analyses excluding oncocytomas, a random forest algorithm showed the highest accuracy, with multiclass AUC = 0.78. Radiomic feature analyses from venous-phase CT acquired in clinical practice with subsequent machine learning can discriminate renal tumor subtypes with moderate accuracy. The classification of oncocytomas seems to be the most complex with the lowest accuracy. © 2020 by the authors.

Many serious accidents have occurred worldwide over the years in mining. Although there have been efforts to create a safer work environment for miners, the number of accidents occurring at the mining sites is still significant. Machine learning techniques and predictive analytics are becoming one of the leading resources to create safer work environments in the manufacturing and construction industries. These techniques are leveraged to generate actionable insights to improve decision-making. A large amount of mining safety-related data are available, and machine learning algorithms can be used to analyze the data. The use of machine learning techniques can significantly benefit the mining industry. Decision tree, random forest, and artificial neural networks were implemented to analyze the outcomes of mining accidents. These machine learning models were also used to predict days away from work. An accidents dataset provided by the Mine Safety and Health Administration was used to train the models. The models were trained separately on tabular data and narratives. The use of a synthetic data augmentation technique using word embedding was also investigated to tackle the data imbalance problem. Performance of all the models was compared with the performance of the traditional logistic regression model. The results show that models trained on narratives performed better than the models trained on structured/tabular data in predicting the outcome of the accident. The higher predictive power of the models trained on narratives led to the conclusion that the narratives have additional information relevant to the outcome of injury compared to the tabular entries. The models trained on tabular data had a lower mean squared error compared to the models trained on narratives while predicting the days away from work. The results highlight the importance of predictors, like shift start time, accident time, and mining experience in predicting the days away from work. It was found that the F1 score of all the underrepresented classes except one improved after the use of the data augmentation technique. This approach gave greater insight into the factors influencing the outcome of the accident and days away from work. © 2020 by the authors.

Due to the lack of experimental data, the number of lncRNAs is very limited, experimentally verified subcellular localization, and the numbers of lncRNAs located in different organelle are wildly imbalanced. The prediction of subcellular location of lncRNAs is actually a multi-classification small sample imbalance problem. The imbalance of data results in the poor recognition effect of machine learning models on small data subsets, which is a puzzling and challenging problem in the existing research. In this study, we integrate multi-source features to construct a sequence-based computational tool, lncLocation, to predict the subcellular location of lncRNAs. Autoencoder is used to enhance part of the features, and the binomial distribution-based filtering method and recursive feature elimination (RFE) are used to filter some of the features. It improves the representation ability of data and reduces the problem of unbalanced multi-classification data. By comprehensive experiments on different feature combinations and machine learning models, we select the optimal features and classifier model scheme to construct a subcellular location prediction tool, lncLocation.

To alleviate the insufficiency of learning from minority-class data, our proposed cost-sensitive SVM loss function reflects different weights of misclassification errors from both majority and minority classes, by controlling cost parameters. Additionally, we present a theoretical setting of the cost parameters in our model. The proposed model is validated on real datasets that range from low to high imbalance ratios.

Early diagnosis is crucial for correct treatment in order to possibly reduce the stress in the healthcare system. The standard image diagnosis tests for pneumonia are chest X-ray (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scan. Although CT scan is the gold standard, CXR are still useful because it is cheaper, faster and more widespread. This study aims to identify pneumonia caused by COVID-19 from other types and also healthy lungs using only CXR images. Methods:In order to achieve the objectives, we have proposed a classification schema considering the following perspectives: i) a multi-class classification; ii) hierarchical classification, since pneumonia can be structured as a hierarchy. Given the natural data imbalance in this domain, we also proposed the use of resampling algorithms in the schema in order to re-balance the classes distribution. We observed that, texture is one of the main visual attributes of CXR images, our classification schema extract features using some well-known texture descriptors and also using a pre-trained CNN model. We also explored early and late fusion techniques in the schema in order to leverage the strength of multiple texture descriptors and base classifiers at once. To evaluate the approach, we composed a database, named RYDLS-20, containing CXR images of pneumonia caused by different pathogens as well as CXR images of healthy lungs. The classes distribution follows a real-world scenario in which some pathogens are more common than others. Results:The proposed approach tested in RYDLS-20 achieved a macro-avg F1-Score of 0.65 using a multi-class approach and a F1-Score of 0.89 for the COVID-19 identification in the hierarchical classification scenario. Conclusions:As far as we know, the top identification rate obtained in this paper is the best nominal rate obtained for COVID-19 identification in an unbalanced environment with more than three classes. We must also highlight the novel proposed hierarchical classification approach for this task, which considers the types of pneumonia caused by the different pathogens and lead us to the best COVID-19 recognition rate obtained here. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chest X-ray; COVID-19; Medical image analysis; Pneumonia; Texture","Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

An abundant amount of effort has been put by the research community to develop software maintainability prediction (SMP) models by relating software metrics to the maintainability of modules or classes. When software classes demanding the high maintainability effort (HME) are less as compared to the low maintainability effort (LME) classes, the situation leads to imbalanced datasets for training the SMP models. The imbalanced class distribution in SMP datasets could be a dilemma for various ML techniques because, in the case of an imbalanced dataset, minority class instances are either misclassified by the ML techniques or get discarded as noise. The recent development in predictive modeling has ascertained that ensemble techniques can boost the performance of ML techniques by collating their predictions. Ensembles themselves do not solve the class-imbalance problem much. However, aggregation of ensemble techniques with the certain techniques to handle class-imbalance problem (e.g., data resampling) has led to several proposals in research. This paper evaluates the performance of ensembles for the class-imbalance in the domain of SMP. The ensembles for class-imbalance problem (ECIP) are the modification of ensembles which pre-process the imbalanced data using data resampling before the learning process. This study experimentally compares the performance of several ECIP using performance metrics Balance and g-Mean over eight Apache software datasets.

Box 843019, Richmond, VA  23284-3019, United States","The imbalanced data classification is one of the most crucial tasks facing modern data analysis. Especially when combined with other difficulty factors, such as the presence of noise, overlapping class distributions, and small disjuncts, data imbalance can significantly impact the classification performance. Furthermore, some of the data difficulty factors are known to affect the performance of the existing oversampling strategies, in particular SMOTE and its derivatives. This effect is especially pronounced in the multi-class setting, in which the mutual imbalance relationships between the classes complicate even further. Despite that, most of the contemporary research in the area of data imbalance focuses on the binary classification problems, while their more difficult multi-class counterparts are relatively unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel oversampling technique, a Multi-Class Combined Cleaning and Resampling (MC-CCR) algorithm. The proposed method utilizes an energy-based approach to modeling the regions suitable for oversampling, less affected by small disjuncts and outliers than SMOTE. It combines it with a simultaneous cleaning operation, the aim of which is to reduce the effect of overlapping class distributions on the performance of the learning algorithms. Finally, by incorporating a dedicated strategy of handling the multi-class problems, MC-CCR is less affected by the loss of information about the inter-class relationships than the traditional multi-class decomposition strategies. Based on the results of experimental research carried out for many multi-class imbalanced benchmark datasets, the high robust of the proposed approach to noise was shown, as well as its high quality compared to the state-of-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Class label noise; Imbalanced data; Machine learning; Multi-class imbalance; Noisy data; Oversampling","Elsevier B.V."

Many peoples choose expressways rather than normal ways due to the reasons of time, traffic, easy of driving, etc. According to police reports of highway main traffic police branch, in recent years the number of accidents occurring in expressways is increasing drastically. Nowadays, the rate of accident occurrence in Colombo-Katunayake Expressway is high compared to the other two expressways and there was no previous research has been done in Sri Lanka regarding accidents on Colombo-Katunayake expressway. Therefore, the objective of the study was to identify the factors contributing to accidents on the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway and to develop appropriate machine learning models to classify the severity of the accidents. In this study, 704 total accident cases were considered during the period 2013-2019. Chi-square test, logistic regression, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to identify the association between the accident severity and other influential variables found from the literature. Finally, seven variables: time category, driver's age category, vehicle type, the reason for the accident, number of vehicles involved, cause for accident and rainfall were identified as influencing variables to accident severity under 5% level of significance. Naïve Bayes classification algorithm and probabilistic neural network (PNN) were used in the study to forecast accident severity. A random under-sampling technique was used to overcome the class imbalanced problem persists in the data set considered in the study. The final models developed using the Naïve Bayes algorithm and PNN exhibit 72.14% and 74.29% overall classification accuracy respectively. Both aforementioned models can be considered as suitable models to forecast accident severity in the Colombo-Katunayake expressway where the PNN model exhibits slightly higher accuracy.

Cloud computing interconnects data and applications served from multiple geographic locations. A large number of transactions and the hidden infrastructure in cloud computing systems have presented a number of challenges to the research community. Among them, maintaining the cloud network security has become a key challenge. For example, detecting anomalous data has been a key research area in cloud computing. Anomaly detection (or outlier detection) is the identification of suspicious or uncommon data that significantly differs from the majority of the data. Recently, machine learning methods have shown their effectiveness in anomaly detection. However, identifying anomalies or outliers using supervised learning methods still a challenging task due to the class imbalance and the unpredictable nature and inconsistent properties or patterns of anomaly data. One-class classifiers are one feasible solution for this issue. In this paper, we mainly focused on analyzing cloud network data for identifying anomalies using one-class classification methods namely One Class Support Vector Machine(OCSVM) and Autoencoder. Here, we used a benchmark data set, YAHOO Synthetic cloud network data set. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that used YAHOO data for detecting anomalies. According to our analysis, Autoencoder achieves 96.02 percent accuracy in detecting outliers and OCSVM achieves 79.05 percent accuracy. In addition, we further investigated the effectiveness of a one class classification method using another benchmarked data set, UNSW-NB15. There we obtained 99.10 percent accuracy for Autoencoder and 60.89 percent accuracy for OCSVM.

A training dataset that is imbalanced leads undesirably to an inaccurate classifier. In this paper, we compare performance of existing methods that tackle class imbalance. These methods are undersampling, oversampling, hybrid, SMOTE, ADASYN, and a method that does not modify the datasets. We choose support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier and estimate classification accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity under each method. The datasets in the comparison cover a wide range of applications and class ratios. The research results indicate that undersampling does not achieve a highest accuracy, sensitivity, or specificity in any benchmark dataset, and is a not a recommended method in general. A method that does not modify the datasets has the most consistent performance; it is statistically most accurate, sensitive, and specific in three, one, and five datasets, respectively, at the significance level of the test at 10%. From the comparison, we find that a suitable method to tackle class imbalance depends on a dataset at hand and that no single method universally performs well across the benchmark datasets.

It is a central task of old age that is essential for healthy aging, and it serves multiple functions, such as decision-making and introspection, transmitting life lessons, and bonding with others. The study of social reminiscence behavior in everyday life can be used to generate data and detect reminiscence from general conversations. Objective: The aims of this original paper are to (1) preprocess coded transcripts of conversations in German of older adults with natural language processing (NLP), and (2) implement and evaluate learning strategies using different NLP features and machine learning algorithms to detect reminiscence in a corpus of transcripts. Methods: The methods in this study comprise (1) collecting and coding of transcripts of older adults' conversations in German, (2) preprocessing transcripts to generate NLP features (bag-of-words models, part-of-speech tags, pretrained German word embeddings), and (3) training machine learning models to detect reminiscence using random forests, support vector machines, and adaptive and extreme gradient boosting algorithms. The data set comprises 2214 transcripts, including 109 transcripts with reminiscence. Due to class imbalance in the data, we introduced three learning strategies: (1) class-weighted learning, (2) a meta-classifier consisting of a voting ensemble, and (3) data augmentation with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) algorithm. For each learning strategy, we performed cross-validation on a random sample of the training data set of transcripts. We computed the area under the curve (AUC), the average precision (AP), precision, recall, as well as F1 score and specificity measures on the test data, for all combinations of NLP features, algorithms, and learning strategies. Results: Class-weighted support vector machines on bag-of-words features outperformed all other classifiers (AUC=0.91, AP=0.56, precision=0.5, recall=0.45, F1=0.48, specificity=0.98), followed by support vector machines on SMOTE-augmented data and word embeddings features (AUC=0.89, AP=0.54, precision=0.35, recall=0.59, F1=0.44, specificity=0.94). For the meta-classifier strategy, adaptive and extreme gradient boosting algorithms trained on word embeddings and bag-of-words outperformed all other classifiers and NLP features; however, the performance of the meta-classifier learning strategy was lower compared to other strategies, with highly imbalanced precision-recall trade-offs. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of the applicability of NLP and machine learning pipelines for the automated detection of reminiscence in older adults' everyday conversations in German. The methods and findings of this study could be relevant for designing unobtrusive computer systems for the real-time detection of social reminiscence in the everyday life of older adults and classifying their functions. With further improvements, these systems could be deployed in health interventions aimed at improving older adults' well-being by promoting self-reflection and suggesting coping strategies to be used in the case of dysfunctional reminiscence cases, which can undermine physical and mental health. © Andrea Ferrario, Burcu Demiray, Kristina Yordanova, Minxia Luo, Mike Martin.

At present, the methods to solve the problem of data imbalance can be divided into data-level methods, algorithm-level methods and hybrid methods. In this paper, we propose a weighted hybrid ensemble method for classifying imbalanced data in binary classification tasks, called WHMBoost. In the framework of the boosting algorithm, the presented method combines two data sampling methods and two base classifiers, and each sampling method and each base classifier is assigned corresponding weights, which makes them have better complementary advantages. The performance of WHMBoost has been evaluated on 40 benchmark imbalanced datasets with state of the art ensemble methods like AdaBoost, RUSBoost, SMOTEBoost using AUC, F-Measure and Geometric Mean as the performance evaluation criteria. Experimental results show significant improvement over the other methods and it can be concluded that WHMBoost is a promising and effective algorithm to deal with imbalance datasets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Base classifiers; Binary classification; Boosting algorithm; Data imbalance; Data sampling methods","Elsevier B.V."

The paper discusses the main approaches for the class imbalance reduction: resampling methods and setting the weight of classes depending on the number of samples observed for an each class. A histogram of oriented gradients is used for the face area localization in the frame stream, then an active shape model is applied, which detects the coordinates of 68 key facial landmarks. Using the coordinates of key landmarks, informative features are extracted that characterize the dynamics of facial expressions. Main Results.

However, late detection of this disease before the first clinical diagnosis has led to increased mortality rate. Research effort towards the early detection of PD has encountered challenges such as: small dataset size, class imbalance, overfitting, high false detection rate, model complexity, etc. This paper aims to improve early detection of PD using machine learning through data augmentation for very small datasets. We propose using Spline interpolation and Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (Pchip) interpolation methods to generate synthetic data instances. We further investigate on reducing dimensionality of features for effective and real-time classification while considering computational complexity of implementation on real-life mobile phones. For classification we use Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) deep learning network and compare the results with traditional machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree, Logistic regression, KNN and Ensemble bagged tree. For experimental validation we use the Oxford Parkinson disease dataset with 195 data samples, which we have augmented with 571 synthetic data samples. The results for BiLSTM shows that even with a holdout of 90%, the model was still able to effectively recognize PD with an average accuracy for ten rounds experiment using 22 features as 82.86%, 97.1%, and 96.37% for original, augmented (Spline) and augmented (Pchip) datasets, respectively. Our results show that proposed data augmentation schemes have significantly (p < 0.001) improved the accuracy of PD recognition on a small dataset using both classical machine learning models and BiLSTM. © 2020 Polish Information Processing Society - as it is since 2011.","data augmentation; deep learning; interpolation; Parkinson's; small data; speech impairment; voice analysis","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, these ground-truth datasets are frequently affected by significant class imbalance as generally they contain much more information regarding legal services (Exchange, Gambling), than regarding services that may be related to illicit activities (Mixer, Service). Class imbalance increases the complexity of applying machine learning techniques and reduces the quality of classification results, especially for underrepresented, but critical classes.In this paper, we propose to address this problem by using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Bitcoin data augmentation as GANs recently have shown promising results in the domain of image classification. However, there is no 'one-fits-all' GAN solution that works for every scenario. In fact, setting GAN training parameters is non-trivial and heavily affects the quality of the generated synthetic data. We therefore evaluate how GAN parameters such as the optimization function, the size of the dataset and the chosen batch size affect GAN implementation for one underrepresented entity class (Mining Pool) and demonstrate how a 'good' GAN configuration can be obtained that achieves high similarity between synthetically generated and real Bitcoin address data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study presenting GANs as a valid tool for generating synthetic address data for data augmentation in Bitcoin entity classification. © 2020 IEEE.","address behaviour; Bitcoin classifier; class imbalance; data augmentation; Generative Adversarial Network","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Highly automated digital environments, such as smart factories and cyber-physical ecosystems, are significantly impacted by these negative effects due to the inherent constraints on human engagement and social interaction. Verbal communication between human operators is a critical resource in such environments, as it can be effectively utilized to address this challenge. A mix of statistical and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been reported in recent literature for the detection of stress-related indicators from audio recordings. However, none of these studies has focused on the challenges of detecting work-related stress in cyber-physical environments, such as smart factories, where verbal communication is not only constrained but also impaired by background noise and other disturbances common to factory settings. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a novel deep learning approach, based on the workings of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Growing Self-Organizing Map (GSOM) algorithms. In addition to this novel AI approach, sampling strategy and speaker diarization techniques are utilised for noise reduction. Pitch and speech augmentation techniques address the data imbalance issue common in most real-world datasets. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using a benchmark dataset (DAIC-WOZ). We report F1 scores of 82% and 64% for normal and distressed classes respectively, which outperform the state-of-the-art models. We conclude with a discussion on the empirical evaluation of the proposed approach in cyber-physical environments and directions for future work. © 2020 IEEE.","Artificial Intelligence; Audio stream in smart factory; cyber physical environment; Cyber Physical Systems; deep learning; distress detection; Growing Self-Organizing Map; Human operators in smart factory; Industry 4.0; Operator 4.0; unsupervised machine learning; Work related stress","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Predicting readmission risk and understanding its causes are thus essential for healthcare resource allocation and quality improvement planning. By using machine learning techniques on initial admission data, this study aimed to develop prediction models for readmission or mortality after stroke. During model development, resampling methods were implemented to balance the class distribution. Two-layer nested cross-validation was used to build and evaluate the prediction models. A total of 3422 patients were included for analysis. The 90-day rate of readmission or mortality was 17.6%. This study identified several important predictive factors, including age, prior emergency department visits, pre-stroke functional status, stroke severity, body mass index, consciousness level, and use of a nasogastric tube. The Naive Bayes model with class weighting to compensate for class imbalance achieved the highest discriminatory capacity in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.661). Despite having room for improvement, the prediction models could be used for early risk assessment of patients with stroke. Identification of patients at high risk for readmission or mortality immediately after admission has the potential of enabling early discharge planning and transitional care interventions. © 2020 by the authors.","Machine learning; Prediction models; Readmission; Risk assessment; Stroke","MDPI AG"

This paper is focused on automatic detection of astrophysical pulses in single-pulse searches, both within and across surveys. We use the output from the first stage of our previously developed two-stage Single-Pulse Event Group IDentification approach and focus on the second stage (i.e., classification of pulse candidates). Specifically, for the first time in time-domain single-pulse searches we (1) use boosting and deep learning algorithms for within-survey classification and (2) investigate cross-survey classification by using two transfer learning methods, trAdaBoost (instance-based) and fine-tuning (parameter-based). Our experimental results are based on two benchmark data sets, Green Bank Telescope Drift-scan (GBTDrift) and Pulsar Arecibo L-band Feed Array (PALFA)-extended, created from the GBTDrift survey and the PALFA survey. The main findings include: (1) Due to the emphasis on high Recall, F4 measure is more appropriate performance indicator than the balanced F1 measure. (2) For the GBTDrift benchmark, AdaBoost outperformed the other models with 98.5% Recall and F4 =0.942. For the PALFA-extended benchmark, RandomForest performed the best, with 91.6% Recall and F4=0.890. (3) Models performance degraded significantly when they were used for pulsar classification across surveys. (4) Transfer learning improved cross-survey classification significantly when training data in the target data set were limited. When the GBTDrift benchmark was used as the target data set, fine-tuned SPEGnet models had the highest F4 measure, while trAdaBoost models had the highest F4 measure when PALFA-extended benchmark was used as the target data set. (5) Pulse classification was affected not only by the between-class imbalance (i.e., pulsar versus non-pulsar), but also by the within-class imbalance, which was more prominent in the case of the PALFA-extended benchmark due to the lack of labeled low signal-to-noise ratio pulsars. © 2020, Institute of Physics Publishing.

Methods: DICOM structure sets from approximately 1200 lung and prostate cancer patients across 40 treatment centers were used to build predictive models to automate the relabeling of clinically specified structure labels to standardized labels as defined by the American Association of Physics in Medicine's (AAPM) Task Group 263 (TG-263). Volumetric bitmaps were created based on the delineated volumes and were combined with associated bony anatomy data to build feature vectors. Feature reduction was performed with singular value decomposition and the resulting vectors were used for predicting the label of each structure using five different classifier algorithms on the Apache Spark platform with 5-fold cross-validation. Undersampling methods were used to deal with underlying class imbalance that hindered the performance of classifiers. Experiments were performed on both a curated version of the data, which included only annotated structures, and the non-curated data that included all structures from the original treatment plans. Results: Random Forest provided the highest accuracies with F1 scores of 98.77 for lung and 95.06 for prostate on the curated data sets. Scores were lower with 95.67 for lung and 90.22 for prostate on the non-curated data sets, highlighting some of the challenges of classifying real clinical data. Including bony anatomy data and pooling information from all structures for the same patient both increased accuracies. In some cases, undersampling with k-Means clustering for class balancing improved classifier accuracy but in all experiments it significantly reduced run time compared to random undersampling. Conclusion: This work shows that structure sets can be relabeled using our approach with accuracies over 95% for many structure types when presented with curated data. Although accuracies dropped when using the full non-curated data sets, some structure types were still correctly labeled over 90% of the time. With similar results obtained on an external test data set, we can infer that the proposed models are likely to work on other clinical data sets. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.","Class imbalance; DICOM; Machine Learning; Radiation Oncology; Random Forest; TG-263","Academic Press Inc."

There has been a pronounced progress in the use of machine learning models for crash events assessment by the transportation safety research community in recent years. However, little attention has been paid so far to evaluating real-time crash occurrences within information fusion systems. The main aim of this paper is to design and validate an ensemble fusion framework founded on the use of various base classifiers that operate on fused features and a Meta classifier that learns from base classifiers’ results to acquire more performant crash predictions. A data-driven approach was adopted to investigate the potential of fusing four real-time and continuous categories of features namely physiological signals, driver maneuvering inputs, vehicle kinematics and weather covariates in order to systematically identify the crash strongest precursors through feature selection techniques. Moreover, a resampling-based scheme, including Bagging and Boosting, is conducted to generate diversity in learner combinations comprising Bayesian Learners (BL), k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). To ensure that the proposed framework provide powerful and stable decisions, an imbalance-learning strategy was adopted using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) to address the class imbalance problem as crash events usually occur in rare instances. The findings show that Boosting depicted the highest performance within the fusion scheme and can accomplish a maximum of 93.66% F1 score and 94.81% G-mean with Naïve Bayes, Bayesian Networks, k-NN and SVM with MLP as the Meta-classifier. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first attempt at establishing a fusing framework on the basis of data from the four aforementioned categories and fusion models while accounting for class imbalance. Overall, the method and findings provide new insights into crash prediction and can be harnessed as a promising tool to improve intervention efforts related to traffic intelligent transportation systems. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Driving behavior; Fusion framework; Machine learning; Real-time crash prediction; SMOTE","Elsevier Ltd"

Ecologists have increasingly used them for studying diverse fauna around the globe. Deep learning methods have gained recent attention for automating the process of species identification in soundscape recordings. We present an end-to-end pipeline for training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for multi-species multi-label classification of soundscape recordings, starting from raw, unlabeled audio. Training data for species-specific signals are collected using a semi-automated procedure consisting of an efficient template-based signal detection algorithm and a graphical user interface for rapid detection validation. A CNN is then trained based on mel-spectrograms of sound to predict the set of species present in a recording. Transfer learning of a pre-trained model is employed to reduce the necessary training data and time. Furthermore, we define a loss function that allows for using true and false template-based detections to train a multi-class multi-label audio classifier. This approach leverages relevant absence (negative) information in training, and reduces the effort in creating multi-label training data by allowing weak labels. We evaluated the pipeline using a set of soundscape recordings collected across 749 sites in Puerto Rico. A CNN model was trained to identify 24 regional species of birds and frogs. The semi-automated training data collection process greatly reduced the manual effort required for training. The model was evaluated on an excluded set of 1000 randomly sampled 1-min soundscapes from 17 sites in the El Yunque National Forest. The test recordings contained an average of ~3 present target species per recording, and a maximum of 8. The test set also showed a large class imbalance with most species being present in less than 5% of recordings, and others present in >25%. The model achieved a mean-average-precision of 0.893 across the 24 species.

The ongoing study shows that artificial intelligence has been accustomed to probe risk factors for hypertension. Factors, like health-damaging personal behaviors and changes in lifestyle and environment, are major contributors to chronic diseases. The goal of this research was to forecast the risk of developing hypertension by revealing hidden patterns in medical datasets. Quality of the data is the key to enhance the performance of learning model. But most healthcare data suffer from class imbalance problem, which induce the need for an intelligent model which can learn from such grimy data. This paper incorporates a novel approach by combing learning model and rule-based mining to offer decision support. Typically, the proposed work comprises two main implications. First suggests an intelligent learning model using boosting-based support vector machine to diagnose and expose multi-class categories in the imbalanced datasets. Finally, the enhanced predictive model is built upon the classification solution which will portray the innate data similarities. An intelligent fuzzy-based approach was employed to recognize frequent behavioral patterns. Based on these rules, valid decisions could be made to prevent hypertension. The suggested enhanced model is evaluated using a real-time hypertension dataset obtained through primary health centers. With the combination of ensemble strategies, the proposed intelligent learning model attains high classification accuracy for the imbalanced dataset above the traditional model. Thus, the efficient integration of personalized behavior with health data could provide a better understanding regarding patient health. In future this can serve as an eye toward personalized medicine. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Boosting mechanism; Fuzzy-based association rule mining; Hypertension; Medical decision support system; Medical diagnosis; Pattern recognition; Support vector machine","Springer"

Nevertheless, in real-world applications, the class of interest to be studied is generally scarce. The data imbalance status may allow high global accuracy through most standard learning algorithms, but it poses a real challenge when considering the minority class accuracy. To deal with this issue, we introduce in this paper a novel adaptation of the decision tree algorithm to imbalanced data situations. A new asymmetric entropy measure is proposed. It adjusts the most uncertain class distribution to the a priori class distribution and involves it in the node splitting-process. Unlike most competitive split criteria, which include only the maximum uncertainty vector in their formula, the proposed entropy is customizable with an adjustable concavity to better comply with the system expectations. The experimental results across thirty-five differently class-imbalanced data-sets show significant improvements over various split criteria adapted for imbalanced situations. Furthermore, being combined with sampling strategies and based-ensemble methods, our entropy proves significant enhancements on the minority class prediction, along with a good handling of the data difficulties related to the class imbalance problem. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Asymmetric decision trees; Classification problem; Entropy measures; Imbalanced data; Index of balanced accuracy","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

Machine learning classifiers can be adopted on the dataset to investigate those compounds. The ratio of the active molecules that achieve the goal of inhibiting APP, nonetheless, is minimal compared to their inactive counterparts. The imbalance between the two classes is handled by introducing cost-sensitivity to reweight the training instances depending on the misclassification cost allotted to each class. The paper shows the performance of cost-sensitive classifiers (Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression classifier) to spot the minority (active) molecules from the majority (inactive) classes and shows their evaluation metrics. Sensitivity, specificity, False Negative rate, ROC area, and accuracy are evaluated while keeping the False Positive rate at 20.6%.

To solve this problem, an improved algorithm called BLW-ELM, which integrates LW-ELM into the Boosting ensemble learning framework, is presented in this paper.

But ELM performs well under the assumption that the data is balanced. Because in binary classification with high imbalanced ratio data, the accuracy of samples from the minority class tends to be ignored easily due to the disadvantage in quantity. Therefore, weighted ELM (W-ELM) was proposed for imbalance learning. When samples are transformed through the hidden layer of W-ELM, W-ELM needs to calculate suitable weights to classify the samples linearly. But it is difficult for W-ELM to achieve a good learning performance when the dispersion of the transformed samples is high enough. Besides, W-ELM is limited by its two weighting schemes. Many W-ELM-based methods, such as boosting W-ELM, deep W-ELM and ensemble W-ELM, were also proposed with the limitations of W-ELM. Class-specific cost regulation ELM (CCR-ELM) is an alternative approach to learn imbalanced data. However, to a certain degree, CCR-ELM is similar to ELM. Therefore, in this paper, we will propose variances-constrained weighted extreme learning machine (VW-ELM) to replace W-ELM. VW-WLM takes the dispersion of training results into consideration. From theoretical view, VW-ELM's learning performance is no lower than W-ELM. We use 21 benchmark datasets to test the learning ability of VW-ELM. Experimental results demonstrate that VW-ELM has an obvious advantage to handle classification problem of imbalanced data, comparing with the state-of-the-arts. © 2020","CCR-ELM; ELM; Imbalanced data; VW-ELM; W-ELM","Elsevier B.V."

The defect has significant commitment and assumes an important job in the hour of freeing software. Software defect-prone might be recognized before the software announcement or after the announcement. Although, the desire for designers is to give defect free software to their customers. Hence, recognizing the software defect-prone before announcement makes a decent preferred position for the designers. Here, the difficult assignment is to discover the defect-prone region or defective module of software. On the off chance that defective modules are distinguished before the arrival of software, at that point it could be effectively counteracted and fixed by the designer. In most recent two decades scientists have concentrated on software deformity prophecy issue by applying a few statistical and machine learning systems. The software defect-prone information experiences the class-imbalance issue due to the slanted conveyance of defective and non-defective software modules. Generally, machine learning calculations consider equivalent circulation of information tests in each class and expect the misclassification cost of each class is similarly significant.

In sensor networks, in collaborative health or genomic projects, in credit risk analysis, among other domains, distinct features are collected from multiple sources, including the use of social media and mobile applications, and due to privacy concerns or communication costs, may not be shared among sites. This scenario of vertical data partitioning poses challenges to traditional machine learning (ML) approaches, as classical algorithms are designed to learn from the complete set of features. A common strategy is to combine predictions from local models trained at each site into a global model, and for this purpose, several aggregation methods have been proposed. In this work we tackle a gap within the related literature, performing a comparative evaluation of elementary and meta-learning-based aggregation methods to reveal their strengths and weakness for 46 datasets with varied characteristics. We show that no method outperforms its counterparts in all domains, emphasizing the need for experimental comparison to ensure a good choice in the domain of interest. Moreover, our experiments provide the first insights into the relations between datasets’ properties and aggregators’ performance. We show that for low class imbalance and a good instance-to-feature ratio, almost all aggregation methods tend to perform well. The silhouette coefficient (reflecting class separability) and class imbalance coefficient are the most influential properties on aggregators’ performance, thus we recommend their analysis in the first step of the methodological design. We found that arithmetic-based methods are not suitable for datasets with poor class separability and a large number of classes, whereas meta-learning approaches are less sensitive for datasets with silhouette coefficient close to 0. Our analyses were summarized as classification and regression trees, which have the impact to serve as practical tools for future research. Taken together, our findings give rise to interesting applications in the domain of intelligent systems, especially regarding their potential to reduce the burden of vast experimental comparisons when training ML models with feature-partitioned data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Attribute-partitioned data; Classification; Distributed machine learning; Predictions aggregation; Vertical data partitioning","Elsevier Ltd"

It is a generalization of the ALADIM processor already validated in the context of landslide mapping and available as a service on the ESA GeoHazards Exploitation Platform (GEP). The proposed chain is able to combine optical and radar images, uses open source libraries, and is optimized for rapid calculation on HPC environments. The ImCLASS processor is presented and its performance is evaluated on three use cases: landslide detection and mapping after disasters in different regions of the World, urban classes change detection with a focus on construction works in Strasbourg, and crop mapping (vineyard) in the Grand-Est region. First results using either bi-dates or mono-date imagery are presented. . © 2020 International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives.","CHANGE DETECTION; CLASSIFICATION; LANDCOVER/USE; MACHINE LEARNING","International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing"

Machine learning algorithms have been applied on UAS-derived images and orthophotos for automated marine litter items detection. As sand and vegetation are much predominant on the orthophoto, marine litter items constitute a small set of data, thus a class much less represented on the image scene. This communication aims to analyse the class imbalance issue on orthophotos for automated marine litter items detection. In the used dataset, the percentage of patches containing marine litter is close to 1% of the total amount of patches, hence representing a clear class imbalance issue. This problem has been previously indicated as detrimental for machine learning frameworks. Three different approaches were tested to address this imbalance, namely class weighting, oversampling and classifier thresholding. Oversampling had the best performance with a f1-score of 0.68, while the other methods had f1-score value of 0.56 on average. The results indicate that future works devoted to UAS-based automated marine litter detection should take in consideration the use of the oversampling method, which helped to improve the results of about 7% in the specific case shown in this paper. © Authors 2020.

Objective: The aims of this study were to develop a prediction model for cardiac arrest in the emergency department (ED) using machine learning and sequential characteristics and to validate its clinical usefulness. Methods: This retrospective study was conducted with ED patients at a tertiary academic hospital who suffered cardiac arrest. To resolve the class imbalance problem, sampling was performed using propensity score matching. The data set was chronologically allocated to a development cohort (years 2013 to 2016) and a validation cohort (year 2017).

As modification of lifestyle takes time, early identification of people with high dementia risk is important for timely intervention and support. As cognitive impairment is a diagnostic criterion of dementia, cognitive assessment tools are used in primary care to screen for clinically unevaluated cases. Among them, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a very common instrument. However, MMSE is a questionnaire that is administered when symptoms of memory decline have occurred. Early administration at the asymptomatic stage and repeated measurements would lead to a practice effect that degrades the effectiveness of MMSE when it is used at later stages. Objective: The aim of this study was to exploit machine learning techniques to assist health care professionals in detecting high-risk individuals by predicting the results of MMSE using elderly health data collected from community-based primary care services. Methods: A health data set of 2299 samples was adopted in the study. The input data were divided into two groups of different characteristics (ie, client profile data and health assessment data). The predictive output was the result of two-class classification of the normal and high-risk cases that were defined based on MMSE. A dual neural network (DNN) model was proposed to obtain the latent representations of the two groups of input data separately, which were then concatenated for the two-class classification. Mean and k-nearest neighbor were used separately to tackle missing data, whereas a cost-sensitive learning (CSL) algorithm was proposed to deal with class imbalance. The performance of the DNN was evaluated by comparing it with that of conventional machine learning methods. Results: A total of 16 predictive models were built using the elderly health data set. Among them, the proposed DNN with CSL outperformed in the detection of high-risk cases. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, average precision, sensitivity, and specificity reached 0.84, 0.88, 0.73, and 0.80, respectively. Conclusions: The proposed method has the potential to serve as a tool to screen for elderly people with cognitive impairment and predict high-risk cases of dementia at the asymptomatic stage, providing health care professionals with early signals that can prompt suggestions for a follow-up or a detailed diagnosis. © 2020 Xiao Shen, Guanjin Wang, Rick Yiu-Cho Kwan, Kup-Sze Choi.","Cognitive screening; Dementia risk; Dual neural network; Predictive models; Primary care","JMIR Publications Inc."

Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to observe a significant degree of class imbalance with only a few instances for minority classes in many datasets, including network traffic traces highly skewed toward a large number of normal connections while very small in quantity for attack instances. A well-known approach to addressing the class imbalance problem is data augmentation that generates synthetic instances belonging to minority classes. However, traditional statistical techniques may be limited since the extended data through statistical sampling should have the same density as original data instances with a minor degree of variation. This paper takes a learning-based approach to data augmentation to enable effective network anomaly detection. One of the critical challenges for the learning-based approach is the mode collapse problem resulting in a limited diversity of samples, which was also observed from our preliminary experimental result. To this end, we present a novel ""Divide-Augment-Combine""(DAC) strategy, which groups the instances based on their characteristics and augments data on a group basis to represent a subset independently using a generative adversarial model. Our experimental results conducted with two recently collected public network datasets (UNSW-NB15 and IDS-2017) show that the proposed technique enhances performances up to 21.5% for identifying network anomalies. © 2020 IEEE.","data augmentation; Divide-Augment-Combine; generative adversarial network; network anomaly detection","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Motor activity is an objective observation of the inner physiological state expressed in behavior patterns. Alterations of motor activity are essential features of bipolar and unipolar depression.

Random Forrest, Deep Neural Network and Convolutional Neural Network algorithms were used to analyze 14 days of actigraph recorded motor activity from 23 depressed patients and 32 healthy controls. Statistical features analyzed in the dataset were mean activity, standard deviation of mean activity and proportion of zero activity. Various techniques to handle data imbalance were applied, and to ensure generalizability and avoid overfitting a Leave-One-User-Out validation strategy was utilized. All outcomes reports as measures of accuracy for binary tests. A Deep Neural Network combined with SMOTE class balancing technique performed a cut above the rest with a true positive rate of 0.82 (sensitivity) and a true negative rate of 0.84 (specificity). Accuracy was 0.84 and the Matthews Correlation Coefficient 0.65.

More recently however, algorithms have been receiving data from the general population in the form of labeling, annotations, etc. The result is that algorithms are subject to bias that is born from ingesting unchecked information, such as biased samples and biased labels. Furthermore, people and algorithms are increasingly engaged in interactive processes wherein neither the human nor the algorithms receive unbiased data. Algorithms can also make biased predictions, leading to what is now known as algorithmic bias. On the other hand, human's reaction to the output of machine learning methods with algorithmic bias worsen the situations by making decision based on biased information, which will probably be consumed by algorithms later. Some recent research has focused on the ethical and moral implication of machine learning algorithmic bias on society. However, most research has so far treated algorithmic bias as a static factor, which fails to capture the dynamic and iterative properties of bias. We argue that algorithmic bias interacts with humans in an iterative manner, which has a long-term effect on algorithms' performance. For this purpose, we present an iterated-learning framework that is inspired from human language evolution to study the interaction between machine learning algorithms and humans. Our goal is to study two sources of bias that interact: the process by which people select information to label (human action); and the process by which an algorithm selects the subset of information to present to people (iterated algorithmic bias mode). We investigate three forms of iterated algorithmic bias (personalization filter, active learning, and random) and how they affect the performance of machine learning algorithms by formulating research questions about the impact of each type of bias. Based on statistical analyses of the results of several controlled experiments, we found that the three different iterated bias modes, as well as initial training data class imbalance and human action, do affect the models learned by machine learning algorithms. We also found that iterated filter bias, which is prominent in personalized user interfaces, can lead to more inequality in estimated relevance and to a limited human ability to discover relevant data. Our findings indicate that the relevance blind spot (items from the testing set whose predicted relevance probability is less than 0.5 and who thus risk being hidden from humans) amounted to 4% of all relevant items when using a content-based filter that predicts relevant items. A similar simulation using a real-life rating data set found that the same filter resulted in a blind spot size of 75% of the relevant testing set. © 2020 Sun et al.",,"Public Library of Science"

It induces biased classification results for minority classes that contain less training samples than others. Most existing approaches aim to remedy the imbalanced number of instances among categories by resampling the majority and minority classes accordingly. However, the imbalanced level of difficulty of recognizing different categories is also crucial, especially for distinguishing samples with many classes. For example, in the task of clinical skin disease recognition, several rare diseases have a small number of training samples, but they are easy to diagnose because of their distinct visual properties. On the other hand, some common skin diseases, e.g., eczema, are hard to recognize due to the lack of special symptoms. To address this problem, we propose a self-paced balance learning (SPBL) algorithm in this paper. Specifically, we introduce a comprehensive metric termed the complexity of image category that is a combination of both sample number and recognition difficulty. First, the complexity is initialized using the model of the first pace, where the pace indicates one iteration in the self-paced learning paradigm. We then assign each class a penalty weight that is larger for more complex categories and smaller for easier ones, after which the curriculum is reconstructed by rearranging the training samples. Consequently, the model can iteratively learn discriminative representations via balancing the complexity in each pace. Experimental results on the SD-198 and SD-260 benchmark data sets demonstrate that the proposed SPBL algorithm performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPBL algorithm's generalization capacity on various tasks, such as indoor scene image recognition and object classification. © 2012 IEEE.","Class imbalance; clinical skin disease recognition; complexity level; self-paced balance learning (SPBL)","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, the vast majority of attention in this field is given to binary problems, while their much more difficult multiclass counterparts are relatively unexplored. Handling data sets with multiple skewed classes poses various challenges and calls for a better understanding of the relationship among classes. In this paper, we propose multiclass radial-based oversampling (MC-RBO), a novel data-sampling algorithm dedicated to multiclass problems. The main novelty of our method lies in using potential functions for generating artificial instances. We take into account information coming from all of the classes, contrary to existing multiclass oversampling approaches that use only minority class characteristics. The process of artificial instance generation is guided by exploring areas where the value of the mutual class distribution is very small. This way, we ensure a smart oversampling procedure that can cope with difficult data distributions and alleviate the shortcomings of existing methods. The usefulness of the MC-RBO algorithm is evaluated on the basis of extensive experimental study and backed-up with a thorough statistical analysis. Obtained results show that by taking into account information coming from all of the classes and conducting a smart oversampling, we can significantly improve the process of learning from multiclass imbalanced data. © 2012 IEEE.","Imbalanced data; machine learning; multiclass imbalance; oversampling","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The designed ACW layer in a deep neural network can calibrate sensors weight according to sensors importance. The recalibrated channel weights can be used as the guidance for sensor position optimization. Furthermore, a new loss function, that is, Focal Loss, is introduced into ACW-CNN to deal with class imbalance generated in real helicopter transmission system (HTS) monitoring. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed ACW-CNN for condition monitoring, two case studies including condition monitoring to gearbox transmission system and helicopter transmission system are carried out. The results of comparative experiments show the proposed method, that is ACW-CNN with Focal Loss, is superior to other methods in classification accuracy, G-mean, and F-measure for condition monitoring of HTS. © 2001-2012 IEEE.","Adaptive channel weight; class imbalance; convolutional neural network; helicopter transmission system; multi-sensor fusion","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

To incorporate this Newtonian concept into kSS, mass to training objects needs to be assigned.

In this paper, a novel sequential ensemble learning (SEL) framework is designed to simultaneously resolve these issues. SEL framework provides a significant property over traditional AdaBoost, in which the majority samples can be divided into multiple small and disjoint subsets for training multiple weak learners without compromising accuracy (while AdaBoost cannot). To ensure the class balance and majority-disjoint property of subsets, a learning strategy called balanced and majority-disjoint subsets division (BMSD) is developed. Unfortunately it is difficult to derive a general learner combination method (LCM) for any kind of weak learner. In this work, LCM is specifically designed for extreme learning machine, called LCM-ELM. The proposed SEL framework with BMSD and LCM-ELM has been compared with state-of-the-art methods over 16 benchmark datasets.

The development of repeatable methods to produce accurate and consistent fire severity maps from satellite imagery is necessary to document fire regimes, to set priorities for post-fire management responses, and for research applications. Machine learning techniques, such as random forest, have shown great promise for mapping of wildfire severity in woodland and forest ecosystems using satellite imagery. However, an assessment of the properties of training data required for automated mapping with random forest is currently lacking. This study examined how training data properties affect fire severity classification across forest, woodland and shrubland communities of southern Australia. The aims of this study were: (i) to examine how sample size (i.e. number of training points and fire events) and sample imbalance affect classification accuracy; (ii) to determine whether models were transferrable across geographic regions; and (iii) to assess the need for classifiers for prescribed burns and wildfires. We sampled 33 wildfires and 57 prescribed burns occurring across southern Australia between 2006 and 2019, to derive an extensive dataset (n = 25, 350 points) suitable for model training and validation. Five fire severity classes were mapped across the forest, woodland and shrubland communities. Using independent spatial cross validation of wildfires, we found that a minimum of 300 sample points per severity class, sampled across at least ten independent fires, was sufficient to reach the upper threshold of classification accuracy for the five severity classes. Training datasets derived across broad environmental space or close (≤100 km) to the target fire (i.e. fire to be mapped) produced better predictions than those derived regionally and far (>100 km) from the target fire. Models trained on data derived from both wildfires and prescribed burns had similar overall accuracy as those trained only on data from the fire type being predicted. However, there were significant differences in accuracy between the models trained with wildfires, prescribed burns and combined datasets within some severity classes. The random forest classifier had an overall accuracy of ~88% for wildfires and ~68% for prescribed burns across the study fires. The discrepancy in accuracy between wildfires and burns was likely due to the poorer classification performance for low fire severity classes, the dominant severity classes in prescribed burns. Overall classification accuracy was relatively consistent across forest, woodland and shrubland communities within the study fires, indicating that the method is robust across the temperate forest biome of southern Australia. Our results demonstrate that consideration of training data properties, specifically the number of points and fires sampled, sample balance and the geographic source of sample data, will be important considerations for the automated mapping of fire severity using random forest classification and Landsat imagery. © 2020","Automated fire mapping; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Temperate forests; Training data; Wildfire severity","Elsevier Inc."

Hence, it is important to identify SBRs quickly and accurately among bug reports (BRs) that have been disclosed in bug tracking systems. Although a few methods have been already proposed for the detection of SBRs, challenging issues still remain due to noisy samples, class imbalance and data scarcity. Object: This motivates us to reveal the potential challenges faced by the state-of-the-art SBRs prediction methods from the viewpoint of data filtering and representation. Furthermore, the purpose of this paper is also to provide a general framework and new solutions to solve these problems. Method: In this study, we propose a novel approach LTRWES that incorporates learning to rank and word embedding into the identification of SBRs. Unlike previous keyword-based approaches, LTRWES is a content-based data filtering and representation framework that has several desirable properties not shared in other methods. Firstly, it exploits ranking model to efficiently filter non-security bug reports (NSBRs) that have higher content similarity with respect to SBRs. Secondly, it applies word embedding technology to transform the rest of NSBRs, together with SBRs, into low-dimensional real-value vectors. Result: Experiment results on benchmark and large real-world datasets show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art method. Conclusion: Overall, the LTRWES is valid with high performance. It will help security engineers to identify SBRs from thousands of NSBRs more accurately than existing algorithms.

IEFSVM considers the diversity of entropy patterns for each sample when increasing the size of neighbors, k, while EFSVM uses single entropy information of the fixed size of neighbors for all samples.

The datasets that have skewed class distribution pose hindrance to conventional learning methods. Conventional learning methods give the same importance to all the examples. This leads to the prediction inclined in favor of the majority classes. To solve this intrinsic deficiency, numerous strategies have been proposed such as weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) and boosting WELM (BWELM). This work designs a novel BalanceCascade-based kernelized extreme learning machine (BCKELM) to tackle the class imbalance problem more effectively. BalanceCascade includes the merits of random undersampling and the ensemble methods. The proposed method utilizes random undersampling to design balanced training subsets. The proposed ensemble generates the base learner in a sequential manner. In each iteration, the correctly classified examples belonging to the majority class are replaced by the other majority class examples to create a new balanced training subset, i.e., the base learners differ in the choice of the balanced training subset. The cardinality of the balanced training subsets depends on the imbalance ratio. This work utilizes a kernelized extreme learning machine (KELM) as the base learner to build the ensemble as it is stable and has good generalization performance. The time complexity of BCKELM is considerably lower in contrast to BWELM, BalanceCascade, EasyEnsemble and hybrid artificial bee colony WELM.

The data used are characterized by the typical problems found in classic data mining applications using real-world data, such as noise and inconsistencies. The two classes are also clearly unbalanced in the data, a problem which is addressed using algorithms that resample the instances. For classification, a series of features are extracted from spatiotemporal data that represent the trajectories of the ships, available from sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports. These features are proposed for the modelling of ship behavior but, because they do not contain context-related information, the classification can be applied in other scenarios.

Automatic analysis of clinical trial eligibility criteria by digital screening, leveraging natural language processing techniques, can improve recruitment efficiency and reduce the costs involved in promoting clinical research. Objective: We aimed to create a natural language processing model to automatically classify clinical trial eligibility criteria. Methods: We proposed a classifier for short text eligibility criteria based on ensemble learning, where a set of pretrained models was integrated. The pretrained models included state-of-the-art deep learning methods for training and classification, including Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), XLNet, and A Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach (RoBERTa). The classification results by the integrated models were combined as new features for training a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) model for eligibility criteria classification. Results: Our proposed method obtained an accuracy of 0.846, a precision of 0.803, and a recall of 0.817 on a standard data set from a shared task of an international conference. The macro F1 value was 0.807, outperforming the state-of-the-art baseline methods on the shared task. Conclusions: We designed a model for screening short text classification criteria for clinical trials based on multimodel ensemble learning. Through experiments, we concluded that performance was improved significantly with a model ensemble compared to a single model.

Such a problem is troublesome because most of the ML algorithms attempt to optimize a loss function that does not take into account the data imbalance. Accordingly, the ML algorithm simply generates a trivial model that is biased toward predicting the most frequent class in the training data. In the case of histopathologic images (HIs), both low-level and high-level data augmentation (DA) techniques still present performance issues when applied in the presence of inter-patient variability; whence the model tends to learn color representations, which is related to the staining process. In this paper, we propose a novel approach capable of not only augmenting HI dataset but also distributing the inter-patient variability by means of image blending using the Gaussian-Laplacian pyramid. The proposed approach consists of finding the Gaussian pyramids of two images of different patients and finding the Laplacian pyramids thereof. Afterwards, the left-half side and the right-half side of different HIs are joined in each level of the Laplacian pyramid, and from the joint pyramids, the original image is reconstructed. This composition combines the stain variation of two patients, avoiding that color differences mislead the learning process.

Some researches have proposed solutions such as resampling for imbalanced traffic classification.

It is a significant challenge to create machine learning models that can classify activities which are not as commonly occurring as other activities. Machine learning models designed to classify imbalanced data are biased towards learning the more commonly occurring classes. Such learning bias occurs naturally, since the models better learn classes which contain more records. This paper examines whether fusing real-world imbalanced multi-modal sensor data improves classification results as opposed to using unimodal data; and compares deep learning approaches to dealing with imbalanced multi-modal sensor data when using various resampling methods and deep learning models. Experiments were carried out using a large multi-modal sensor dataset generated from the Sensor Platform for HEalthcare in a Residential Environment (SPHERE). The data comprises 16104 samples, where each sample comprises 5608 features and belongs to one of 20 activities (classes). Experimental results using SPHERE demonstrate the challenges of dealing with imbalanced multi-modal data and highlight the importance of having a suitable number of samples within each class for sufficiently training and testing deep learning models. Furthermore, the results revealed that when fusing the data and using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to correct class imbalance, CNN-LSTM achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93.67% followed by CNN, 93.55%, and LSTM, i.e. 92.98%. © 2020 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Human Activity Recognition; imbalanced data; multi-modal data; multi-sensor data","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Machine learning algorithms are frequently applied in HAR systems to learn from labeled sensor data. The effectiveness of these algorithms generally relies on having access to lots of accurately labeled training data. But labeled data for HAR is hard to come by and is often heavily imbalanced in favor of one or other dominant classes, which in turn leads to poor recognition performance.In this study we introduce a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approach for HAR that we use to automatically synthesize balanced and realistic sensor data. GANs are robust generative networks, typically used to create synthetic images that cannot be distinguished from real images. Here we explore and construct a model for generating several types of human activity sensor data using a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). We assess the synthetic data using two commonly-used classifier models, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We evaluate the quality and diversity of the synthetic data by training on synthetic data and testing on real sensor data, and vice versa. We then use synthetic sensor data to oversample the imbalanced training set. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on two publicly available human activity datasets, the Sussex-Huawei Locomotion (SHL) and Smoking Activity Dataset (SAD). We achieve improvements of using WGAN augmented training data over the imbalanced case, for both SHL (0.85 to 0.95 F1-score), and for SAD (0.70 to 0.77 F1-score) when using a CNN activity classifier. © 2020 IEEE.","generative adversarial network; human activity recognition; imbalance sensor data","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

While building classifiers for Astronomy, the cost of losing a rare object like supernovae or quasars to detection losses is far more severe than having many false positives, given the rarity and scientific value of these objects. In this paper, a Linear Support Vector Machine (LSVM) is explored to detect Quasars, which are extremely bright objects in which a supermassive black hole is surrounded by a luminous accretion disk. In Astronomy, it is vital to correctly identify quasars, as they are very rare in nature. Their rarity creates a class-imbalance problem that needs to be taken into consideration. The class-imbalance problem and high cost of misclassification are taken into account while designing the classifier. To achieve this detection, a novel classifier is explored, and its performance is evaluated.

Therefore, to overcome these problems, this paper proposes a new class weighted Extreme Gradient Boosting (CW-XGB) based HT detection technique, which detects Trojans from gate-level netlist using the best set of SCOAP feature values. A weighting scheme is proposed in the CW-XGB model to tackle class imbalance problem by assigning higher weights to minority Trojan-inserted class, thus removing the need to apply the oversampling/synthetic data algorithm. Moreover, the proposed model automatically addresses the overfitting issue by incorporating the regularization in the loss function. Besides, we also employ early stopping to avoid the over-training of the proposed model.

Software defect prediction models assist in identifying defect prone modules with the help of historical data, which in turn improves software quality. Historical data consists of data related to modules /files/classes which are labeled as buggy or clean. As the number of buggy artifacts as less as compared to clean artifacts, the nature of historical data becomes imbalance. Due to this uneven distribution of the data, it difficult for classification algorithms to build highly effective SDP models. The objective of this study is to propose a new nonlinear geometric framework based on SMOTE and ensemble learning to improve the performance of SDP models. The study combines the traditional SMOTE algorithm and the novel ensemble Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to develop the proposed framework called SMEnsemble. SMOTE algorithm handles the class imbalance problem by generating synthetic instances of the minority class. Ensemble learning generates multiple classification models to select the best performing SDP model. For experimentation, datasets from three different software repositories that contain both open source as well as proprietary projects are used in the study. The results show that SMEnsemble performs better than traditional methods for identifying the minority class i.e. buggy artifacts. Also, the proposed model performance is better than the latest state of Art SDP model- SMOTUNED. The proposed model is capable of handling imbalance classes when compared with traditional methods. Also, by carefully selecting the number of ensembles high performance can be achieved in less time. © 2020, IGI Global.

We also examined the effect of sampling techniques on the models when dealing with class imbalance. The sampling techniques used had a significant impact on the classification and resulted in an improvement in risk status prediction by facilitating an increase in the information contained within each variable. Based on domain expert criteria the best three classification models for the female and male cohort visceral fat prediction were identified. The Area Under Receiver Operator Characteristic curve of the models tested (with external data) was 0.78 to 0.89 for females and 0.75 to 0.86 for males. These encouraging results will be used to guide further development of models to enable prediction of VAT value. This will be useful to identify individuals with excess VAT volume who are at risk of developing metabolic disease ensuring relevant lifestyle interventions can be appropriately targeted. © 2020, The Author(s).","Imbalanced learning; Machine learning; Random under sampling; Synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE); UK biobank; Visceral fat","Springer"

The study area of this work was the Fregeneda-Almendra region (Spain-Portugal) where the support vector machine (SVM) was employed. Lithium (Li)-pegmatite exploration using satellite data presents some challenges since pegmatites are, by nature, small, narrow bodies. Consequently, the following objectives were defined: (i) train several SVM's on Sentinel-2 images with different parameters to find the optimal model; (ii) assess the impact of imbalanced data; (iii) develop a successful methodological approach to delineate target areas for Li-exploration. Parameter optimization and model evaluation was accomplished by a two-staged grid-search with cross-validation. Several new methodological advances were proposed, including a region of interest (ROI)-based splitting strategy to create the training and test subsets, a semi-automatization of the classification process, and the application of a more innovative and adequate metric score to choose the best model. The proposed methodology obtained good results, identifying known Li-pegmatite occurrences as well as other target areas for Li-exploration. Also, the results showed that the class imbalance had a negative impact on the SVM performance since known Li-pegmatite occurrences were not identified. The potentials and limitations of the methodology proposed are highlighted and its applicability to other case studies is discussed. © 2020 by the authors.","Lithium; Lithological mapping; Machine learning; Mineral exploration; Pegmatite; Remote sensing; Sentinel-2; Supervised classification","MDPI AG"

The attacks perpetrated by internal sources are also referred to as insider threats. These are a cause of serious concern to organizations because of the significant damage that can be inflicted by malicious insiders. In this paper, we propose an approach for insider threat classification which is motivated by the effectiveness of pre-trained deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) for image classification. In the proposed approach, we extract features from usage patterns of insiders and represent these features as images. Hence, images are used to represent the resource access patterns of the employees within an organization. After construction of images, we use pre-trained DCNNs for anomaly detection, with the aim to identify malicious insiders. Random under sampling is used for reducing the class imbalance issue. The proposed approach is evaluated using the MobileNetV2, VGG19, and ResNet50 pre-trained models, and a benchmark dataset.

Automated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are now acquiring high-quality images of aircraft in order to perform offline analysis. At first, some acquisitions are annotated by human operators in order to provide a large dataset required to train machine learning methods, especially for critical defect detection. An intrinsic problem of this dataset is its extreme imbalance (i.e., there is an unequal distribution between classes). The rarest and most valuable samples represent few elements among thousands of annotated objects. Deep learning (DL)-only based approaches have proven to be very effective when a sufficient amount of data are available for each desired class, whereas few-shot learning (FSL)-dedicated methods (matching network, prototypical network, etc.) can learn from only few samples. In a previous work, those approaches were compared on our applicative case and it was demonstrated that combining DL model and prototypical neural network in a hybrid architecture improves the results. We extend this work by questioning the interface between models in such a hybrid architecture.

Recently, the machine learning (ML)-based approach has attracted increasing interest in the research of software vulnerability detection. However, the detection performance of existing ML-based methods require further improvement. There are two challenges: one is code representation for ML and the other is class imbalance between vulnerable code and nonvulnerable code. To overcome these challenges, this article develops a DeepBalance system, which combines the new ideas of deep code representation learning and fuzzy-based class rebalancing. We design a deep neural network with bidirectional long short-term memory to learn invariant and discriminative code representations from labeled vulnerable and nonvulnerable code. Then, a new fuzzy oversampling method is employed to rebalance the training data by generating synthetic samples for the class of vulnerable code. To evaluate the performance of the new system, we carry out a series of experiments in a real-world ground-truth dataset that consists of the code from the projects of LibTIFF, LibPNG, and FFmpeg. The results show that the proposed new system can significantly improve the vulnerability detection performance.

The solution is a binary classification that classifies ship trajectories into either fishing or non-fishing ships. The data used are characterized by the typical problems found in classic data mining applications using real-world data, such as noise and inconsistencies. The two classes are also clearly unbalanced in the data, a problem which is addressed using algorithms that resample the instances. For classification, a series of features are extracted from spatiotemporal data that represent the trajectories of the ships, available from sequences of Automatic Identification System (AIS) reports. These features are proposed for the modelling of ship behavior but, because they do not contain context-related information, the classification can be applied in other scenarios. Experimentation shows that the proposed data preparation process is useful for the presented classification problem.

Methods: We present a procedure, ModGraProDep, based on graphical modeling (GM) of a dataset to overcome these two issues. The performance of the models derived from ModGraProDep is compared with a set of frequently used classification and machine learning algorithms (Missing Data Problem) and with oversampling algorithms (Synthetic Data Simulation). For the Missing Data Problem we assessed two scenarios: missing completely at random (MCAR) and missing not at random (MNAR). Two validated BC datasets provided by the cancer registries of Girona and Tarragona (northeastern Spain) were used. Results: In both MCAR and MNAR scenarios all models showed poorer prediction performance compared to three GM models: the saturated one (GM.SAT) and two with penalty factors on the partial likelihood (GM.K1 and GM.TEST). However, GM.SAT predictions could lead to non-reliable conclusions in BC survival analysis. Simulation of a “synthetic” dataset derived from GM.SAT could be the worst strategy, but the use of the remaining GMs models could be better than oversampling. Conclusion: Our results suggest the use of the GM-procedure presented for one-variable imputation/prediction of missing data and for simulating “synthetic” BC survival datasets. The “synthetic” datasets derived from GMs could be also used in clinical applications of cancer survival data such as predictive risk analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Breast cancer; Graphical models; Missing data; Oversampling; Simulation; Survival","Elsevier B.V."

TWSVM is computationally efficient model of support vector machines (SVM). However, in real world classification problems issues of class imbalance and noise provide great challenges. Due to this, models lead to the inaccurate classification either due to higher tendency towards the majority class or due to the presence of noise. We provide an improved version of robust fuzzy least squares twin support vector machine (RFLSTSVM) known as regularized robust fuzzy least squares twin support vector machine (RRFLSTSVM) to handle the imbalance problem. The advantage of RRFLSTSVM over RFLSTSVM is that the proposed RRFLSTSVM implements the structural risk minimization principle by the introduction of regularization term in the primal formulation of the objective functions. This modification leads to the improved classification as it embodies the marrow of statistical learning theory. The proposed RRFLSTSVM doesn't require any extra assumption as the matrices resulting in the dual are positive definite. However, RFLSTSVM is based on the assumption that the inverse of the matrices resulting in the dual always exist as the matrices are positive semi-definite. To subsidize the effects of class imbalance and noise, the data samples are assigned weights via fuzzy membership function. The fuzzy membership function incorporates the imbalance ratio knowledge and assigns appropriate weights to the data samples. Unlike TWSVM which solves a pair of quadratic programming problem (QPP), the proposed RRFLSTSVM method solves a pair of system of linear equations and hence is computationally efficient. Experimental and statistical analysis show the efficacy of the proposed RRFLSTSVM method. © 2020 IEEE.","class imbalance; Fuzzy Membership; Support vector machines; Twin support vector machines","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The O-RBM is able to construct and adapt the architecture of a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) artificial neural network, according to the statistics of the streaming input data. Specifically, for a training data that is not fully available at the onset of training, the proposed O-RBM begins with a single neuron in the hidden layer of the RBM, progressively adds and suitably adapts the network to account for the variations in streaming data distributions. Such an unsupervised learning helps to effectively model the probability distribution of the entire data stream, and generates robust features. We will demonstrate that such unsupervised representations can be used for discriminative classifications on a set of multi-category and binary classification problems for unstructured image and structured signal data sets, having varying degrees of class-imbalance. We first demonstrate the O-RBM algorithm and characterize the network evolution using the simple and conventional multi-class MNIST image dataset, aimed at recognizing hand-written digit. We then benchmark O-RBM performance to other machine learning, neural network and Class RBM techniques using a number of public non-stationary datasets. Finally, we study the performance of the O-RBM on a real-world problem involving predictive maintenance of an aircraft component using time series data. In all these studies, it is observed that the O-RBM converges to a stable, concise network architecture, wherein individual neurons are inherently discriminative to the class labels despite unsupervised training. It can be observed from the performance results that on an average O-RBM improves accuracy by 2.5%–3% over conventional offline batch learning techniques while requiring at least 24%–70% fewer neurons. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Online learning; Restricted Boltzmann Machine; Unsupervised representation","Elsevier Ltd"

Building such classifiers requires a sufficient amount of training data that is not available at the beginning of a software project. Cross-Project (CP) JIT-SDP can overcome this issue by using data from other projects to build the classifier, achieving similar (not better) predictive performance to classifiers trained on Within-Project (WP) data. However, such approaches have never been investigated in realistic online learning scenarios, where WP software changes arrive continuously over time and can be used to update the classifiers. It is unknown to what extent CP data can be helpful in such situation. In particular, it is unknown whether CP data are only useful during the very initial phase of the project when there is little WP data, or whether they could be helpful for extended periods of time. This work thus provides the first investigation of when and to what extent CP data are useful for JIT-SDP in a realistic online learning scenario. For that, we develop three different CP JIT-SDP approaches that can operate in online mode and be updated with both incoming CP and WP training examples over time.We also collect 2048 commits from three software repositories being developed by a software company over the course of 9 to 10 months, and use 19,8468 commits from 10 active open source GitHub projects being developed over the course of 6 to 14 years. The study shows that training classifiers with incoming CP+WP data can lead to improvements in G-mean of up to 53.90% compared to classifiers using only WP data at the initial stage of the projects. For the open source projects, which have been running for longer periods of time, using CP data to supplement WP data also helped the classifiers to reduce or prevent large drops in predictive performance that may occur over time, leading to up to around 40% better G-Mean during such periods. Such use of CP data was shown to be beneficial even after a large number of WP data were received, leading to overall G-means up to 18.5% better than those of WP classifiers. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Class imbalance; Concept drift; Cross-project learning; Online learning; Software defect prediction; Transfer learning; Verification latency","IEEE Computer Society"

The training of a machine learning-based model is inseparable from a large number of training samples. However, compared with stable samples, unstable samples in power systems are infrequent. The results of the model evaluation are biased due to the imbalance of training samples. Faced with such a problem, a framework based on deep imbalanced learning is proposed. Firstly, for each sample, the samples nearby in the opposite class are applied to calculate its space information. Based on the space information of all samples, the spatial distribution characteristics of the training samples are obtained. And then, in order to obtain balanced training samples, unstable samples are generated according to their spatial distribution characteristics. Finally, stacked sparse denoising auto-encoder (SSDAE) based model, which has the ability of anti-noise, is established as the classifier.

As such, it is important to detect FSF, since such companies tend to conceal bad information, which causes a great loss to various stakeholders. Thus, the objective of the paper is to propose a novel approach to building a classification model to identify FSF, which shows high classification performance and from which human-readable rules are extracted to explain why a company is likely to commit FSF. Design/methodology/approach: Having prepared multiple sub-datasets to cope with class imbalance problem, we build a set of decision trees for each sub-dataset; select a subset of the set as a model for the sub-dataset by removing the tree, each of whose performance is less than the average accuracy of all trees in the set; and then select one such model which shows the best accuracy among the models. We call the resulting model MRF (Modified Random Forest). Given a new instance, we extract rules from the MRF model to explain whether the company corresponding to the new instance is likely to commit FSF or not. Findings: Experimental results show that MRF classifier outperformed the benchmark models. The results also revealed that all the variables related to profit belong to the set of the most important indicators to FSF and that two new variables related to gross profit which were unapprised in previous studies on FSF were identified. Originality/value: This study proposed a method of building a classification model which shows the outstanding performance and provides decision rules that can be used to explain the classification results.

To maintain networks as safe and secure, the Intrusion Detection S ystem (IDS) have become very critical. Intrusion Detection S ystems (IDS) are designed to protect the network by identifying anomaly behaviors or improper uses. Intrusion Detection systems provide more meticulous security functionality than access control barriers by detecting attempted and successful attacks at the end-point or within the network. Intrusion prevention systems are the next logical step to this approach as they can take real-time action against breaches. To have an accurate IDS, detailed visibility is required into the network traffic. The intrusion detection system should be able to detect inside the network threats as well as access control breaches. IDS has been around for a very long time now. These traditional IDS were rules and signature-based. Though they were able to reduce false positives they were not able to detect new attacks. In today's world due to the growth of connectivity, attacks have increased at an exponential rate and it has become essential to use a data-driven approach to tackle these issues. In this paper, the KDD data set was used to train the unsupervised machine learning algorithm called Isolation Forest. The data set is highly imbalanced and contains various attacks such as DOS, Probe, U2R, R2L.

Being co-holders in the same server provides attackers with an opportunity to track the activities of other users and accordingly make an attack when the security of the latter is in peril. Traditionally, the effort has been to build full proof network architectures free from any threats and attacks. However, owing to its open-ended nature, it is impossible to come up with a completely secure architecture. A common factor that can always be observed irrespective of the type of attacks is the specific values and configuration of the system through which the attack is instantiated. The rise in the use of machine learning algorithms and data collection facilities provides us with an opportunity to use network parameter values for modeling any anomaly and subsequent possibility of attacks. In this paper, we propose an ensemble-based meta classifier for predicting the probability of attack instantiation based on certain system parameter values. We also contribute to the research in this area by creating a dataset for analysis purpose. Efforts are taken by us to tackle the class imbalance problem often found in this domain where the instances of attack being carried out are rare.

The classification technique based on the automotive radar sensor has been paid more attention by related researchers, owing to its robustness to low-light conditions and severe weather. In the paper, we propose a hybrid support vector machine–convolutional neural network (SVM-CNN) approach to address the class-imbalance classification of vehicles and pedestrians with limited experimental radar data available. A two-stage scheme with the combination of feature-based SVM technique and deep learning-based CNN is employed. In the first stage, the modified SVM technique based on these distinct physical features is firstly used to recognize vehicles to effectively alleviate the imbalance ratio of vehicles to pedestrians in the data level. Then, the residual unclassified images will be used as inputs to the deep network for the subsequent classification, and we introduce a weighted false error function into deep network architectures to enhance the class-imbalance classification performance at the algorithm level. The proposed SVM-CNN approach takes full advantage of both the locations of underlying class in the entire Range-Doppler image and automatical local feature learning in the CNN with sliding filter bank to improve the classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performances of the proposed method with the F1 score of 0.90 and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.99 over several state-of-the-art methods with limited experimental radar data available in a 77 GHz automotive radar. © 2020 by the authors.

The results reveal that the cost-sensitive learning is able to increase the performance of all the algorithms evaluated, especially their true positive rate.

The aim of this work was to simulate distributed learning models by ensembling with artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF) and evaluate them using four medical datasets. Distributed learning by ensembling locally trained agents improved performance compared to models trained using the data from a single institution, even in cases where only a very few training examples are available per local center. Distributed learning improved when more locally trained models were added to the ensemble.

Various pattern classification problems such as fault or disease detection involve class imbalanced data. The support vector machine (SVM) classifier becomes biased towards the majority class due to class imbalance. Moreover, in the existing SVM based techniques for class imbalance, there is no information about the distribution of data. Motivated by the idea of prior information about data distribution, a reduced universum twin support vector machine for class imbalance learning (RUTSVM-CIL) is proposed in this paper. For the first time, universum learning is incorporated with SVM to solve the problem of class imbalance. Oversampling and undersampling of data is performed to remove the imbalance in the classes. The universum data points are used to give prior information about the data. To reduce the computation time of our universum based algorithm, we use a small sized rectangular kernel matrix. The reduced kernel matrix needs less storage space, and thus applicable for large scale imbalanced datasets. Comprehensive experimentation is performed on various synthetic, real world and large scale imbalanced datasets. In comparison to the existing approaches for class imbalance, the proposed RUTSVM-CIL gives better generalization performance for most of the benchmark datasets. Also, the computation cost of RUTSVM-CIL is very less, making it suitable for real world applications. © 2020","Class imbalance; Imbalance ratio; Rectangular kernel; Twin support vector machine; Universum","Elsevier Ltd"

This paper proposes a study of different MOOD approaches for ensemble learning. First, a taxonomy on multi-objective ensemble learning (MOEL) is proposed. In it, four types of existing approaches are defined: multi-objective ensemble member generation, multi-objective ensemble member selection, multi-objective ensemble member combination, and multi-objective ensemble member selection and combination. Additionally, new approaches can be derived by combining the previous ones, such as multi-objective ensemble member generation and selection, multi-objective ensemble member generation and combination and multi-objective ensemble member generation, selection and combination. With the given taxonomy, two experiments are conducted for comparing (1) the performance of the MOEL techniques for generating and aggregating base models on several imbalanced benchmark problems and (2) the performance of MOEL techniques against other machine learning techniques in a real-world imbalanced drinking-water quality anomaly detection problem. Finally, results indicate that MOOD is able to improve the predictive performance of existing ensemble learning techniques. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Ensemble learning; Imbalanced data sets; Multi-objective optimization","Elsevier Ltd"

In this paper, we propose an imbalanced generative adversarial fusion network (IGAFN) to cope with the class imbalance credit scoring based on multi-source heterogeneous credit data. Concretely, we design a fusion module to integrate the heterogeneous credit data from multiple sources into a unified latent feature space. A generative adversarial network-based balance module is then designed to generate latent representations of new samples for the minority class of the imbalanced datasets. The performance of IGAFN is compared against multiple conventional machine learning and deep learning algorithms.

The aim of our study was to develop and validate a radiomics classifier that classifies breast cancer pCR post-NAC on MRI prior to surgery. Methods: This retrospective study included women treated with NAC for breast cancer from 2014 to 2016 with (1) pre- and post-NAC breast MRI and (2) post-NAC surgical pathology report assessing response. Automated radiomics analysis of pre- and post-NAC breast MRI involved image segmentation, radiomics feature extraction, feature pre-filtering, and classifier building through recursive feature elimination random forest (RFE-RF) machine learning. The RFE-RF classifier was trained with nested five-fold cross-validation using (a) radiomics only (model 1) and (b) radiomics and molecular subtype (model 2). Class imbalance was addressed using the synthetic minority oversampling technique. Results: Two hundred seventy-three women with 278 invasive breast cancers were included; the training set consisted of 222 cancers (61 pCR, 161 no-pCR; mean age 51.8 years, SD 11.8), and the independent test set consisted of 56 cancers (13 pCR, 43 no-pCR; mean age 51.3 years, SD 11.8). There was no significant difference in pCR or molecular subtype between the training and test sets. Model 1 achieved a cross-validation AUROC of 0.72 (95% CI 0.64, 0.79) and a similarly accurate (P = 0.1) AUROC of 0.83 (95% CI 0.71, 0.94) in both the training and test sets. Model 2 achieved a cross-validation AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI 0.72, 0.87) and a similar (P = 0.9) AUROC of 0.78 (95% CI 0.62, 0.94) in both the training and test sets. Conclusions: This study validated a radiomics classifier combining radiomics with molecular subtypes that accurately classifies pCR on MRI post-NAC. © 2020 The Author(s).","Breast cancer; Machine learning; MRI; Neoadjuvant chemotherapy; Radiomics","BioMed Central Ltd."

Curated databases of chemical reactions exist but these databases struggle to keep up with the exponential growth of the biomedical literature. Conventional text mining pipelines provide tools to automatically extract entities and relationships from the scientific literature, and partially replace expert curation, but such machine learning frameworks often require a large amount of labeled training data and thus lack scalability for both larger document corpora and new relationship types. Results: We developed an application of Snorkel, a weakly supervised learning framework, for extracting chemical reaction relationships from biomedical literature abstracts. For this work, we defined a chemical reaction relationship as the transformation of chemical A to chemical B. We built and evaluated our system on small annotated sets of chemical reaction relationships from two corpora: curated bacteria-related abstracts from the MetaCyc database (MetaCyc_Corpus) and a more general set of abstracts annotated with MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) term Bacteria (Bacteria_Corpus; a superset of MetaCyc_Corpus). For the MetaCyc_Corpus, we obtained 84% precision and 41% recall (55% F1 score). Extending to the more general Bacteria_Corpus decreased precision to 62% with only a four-point drop in recall to 37% (46% F1 score). Overall, the Bacteria_Corpus contained two orders of magnitude more candidate chemical reaction relationships (nine million candidates vs 68,0000 candidates) and had a larger class imbalance (2.5% positives vs 5% positives) as compared to the MetaCyc_Corpus. In total, we extracted 6871 chemical reaction relationships from nine million candidates in the Bacteria_Corpus. Conclusions: With this work, we built a database of chemical reaction relationships from almost 900,000 scientific abstracts without a large training set of labeled annotations. Further, we showed the generalizability of our initial application built on MetaCyc documents enriched with chemical reactions to a general set of articles related to bacteria. © 2020 The Author(s).","Chemical reactions; Curation; Database; Snorkel; Text mining","BioMed Central Ltd."

The fundamental principle of these methods is rebalancing an unbalanced dataset by a concrete strategy. Herein, we introduce a novel hybrid proposal named ant colony optimization resampling (ACOR) to overcome class imbalance classification. ACOR primarily includes two steps: first, it rebalances an imbalanced dataset by a specific oversampling algorithm; next, it finds an (sub)optimal subset from the balanced dataset by ant colony optimization. Unlike other oversampling techniques, ACOR does not focus on the mechanics of generating new samples. The main advantage of ACOR is that existing oversampling algorithms can be fully utilized and an ideal training set can be obtained by ant colony optimization. Therefore, ACOR can enhance the performance of existing oversampling algorithms. Experimental results on 18 real imbalanced datasets prove that ACOR yields significantly better results compared with four popular oversampling methods in terms of various assessment metrics, such as AUC, G-mean, and BACC. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Ant colony optimization resampling; Imbalanced learning; Machine learning; Oversampling","Elsevier B.V."

Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is one of the serine/threonine protein kinase, and plays an integral role in autophagy pathway. Autophagy is a cellular pathway for recycling of macromolecules (proteins, lipids, and organelles), which enables eukaryotic cells to adapt metabolism to survive during adverse growth conditions. Targeting mTOR through therapeutic interventions of autophagy pathway establishes mTOR a promising pharmacological target for autophagy modulation in cancer. The bioactivity dataset of mTOR in ChEMBL, a compound bioactivity database maintained by European Bioinformatics Institute, shows disproportionate distribution of active and inactive classes. The predictive models based on this skewed dataset are biased towards prediction of majority class. Hence, we have used Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique to deal with class-imbalance problem in bioactivity datasets. We have built and evaluated predictive models based on four commonly used classifiers using both class-imbalanced and class-balanced bioactivity datasets, and compared their performance based on various metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-measure, and AUC. We observe that the classification models based on balanced dataset generally outperform those that are based on class-imbalanced dataset, irrespective of the classifiers used for classification task. We conclude that predictive models trained over class-balanced dataset can be used for screening large compound bioactivity datasets to predict mTOR inhibitors-like compounds. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Autophagy; Class imbalance; Drug discovery; Kinase; Machine learning; mTOR; Proteomics; SMOTE; Virtual screening","Springer"

An appropriate prediction model should be developed for these diseases. However, previous models did not demonstrate robust performances and/or they were developed from datasets with highly imbalanced classes. Objective: In this study, we developed a predictive model of PDDs by machine learning that uses features at 24-37 weeks' gestation, including maternal characteristics, uterine artery (UtA) Doppler measures, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1 (sFlt-1), and placental growth factor (PlGF). Methods: A public dataset was taken from a prospective cohort study that included pregnant women with PDDs (66/95, 69%) and a control group (29/95, 31%). Preliminary selection of features was based on a statistical analysis using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute). We used Weka (Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) 3.8.3 (The University of Waikato, Hamilton, NZ) to automatically select the best model using its optimization algorithm. We also manually selected the best of 23 white-box models. Models, including those from recent studies, were also compared by interval estimation of evaluation metrics. We used the Matthew correlation coefficient (MCC) as the main metric. It is not overoptimistic to evaluate the performance of a prediction model developed from a dataset with a class imbalance. Repeated 10-fold cross-validation was applied. Results: The classification via regression model was chosen as the best model. Our model had a robust MCC (.93, 95% CI. 87-1.00, vs .64, 95% CI .57-.71) and specificity (100%, 95% CI 100-100, vs 90%, 95% CI 90-90) compared to each metric of the best models from recent studies. The sensitivity of this model was not inferior (95%, 95% CI 91-100, vs 100%, 95% CI 92-100). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was also competitive (0.970, 95% CI 0.966-0.974, vs 0.987, 95% CI 0.980-0.994). Features in the best model were maternal weight, BMI, pulsatility index of the UtA, sFlt-1, and PlGF. The most important feature was the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio. This model used an M5P algorithm consisting of a decision tree and four linear models with different thresholds. Our study was also better than the best ones among recent studies in terms of the class balance and the size of the case class (66/95, 69%, vs 27/239, 11.3%). Conclusions: Our model had a robust predictive performance. It was also developed to deal with the problem of a class imbalance. In the context of clinical management, this model may improve maternal mortality and neonatal morbidity and reduce health care costs. © 2020 Herdiantri Sufriyana, Yu-Wei Wu, Emily Chia-Yu Su.","Intrauterine growth restriction; Machine learning; Preeclampsia; SFlt-1/PlGF ratio; Uterine artery Doppler","JMIR Publications Inc."

ECG datasets containing AF samples, however, usually suffer from severe class imbalance, which if unaccounted for, affects the performance of classification algorithms.

In the context of bioacoustics, this issue may be circumvented by aggregating species labels into super-groups of higher taxonomic rank: genus, family, order, and so forth. However, different applications of machine listening to wildlife monitoring may require different levels of granularity. This paper introduces TaxoNet, a deep neural network for structured classification of signals from living organisms. TaxoNet is trained as a multitask and multilabel model, following a new architectural principle in end-to-end learning named ""hierarchical composition"": shallow layers extract a shared representation to predict a root taxon, while deeper layers specialize recursively to lower-rank taxa. In this way, TaxoNet is capable of handling taxonomic uncertainty, out-of-vocabulary labels, and open-set deployment settings. An experimental benchmark on two new bioacoustic datasets (ANAFCC and BirdVox-14SD) leads to state-of-the-art results in bird species classification. Furthermore, on a task of coarse-grained classification, TaxoNet also outperforms a flat single-task model trained on aggregate labels. © 2020 IEEE.","Acoustic signal detection; audio databases; classification algorithms; multilayer neural network; phylogeny","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

An automated clinical retinal screening process would be highly beneficial and provide a valuable second opinion for doctors worldwide. A computer-aided system to detect and grade the retinal images would enhance the workflow of endocrinologists. Approach: For this research, we make use of a publicly available dataset comprised of 3662 images. We present a hybrid machine learning architecture to detect and grade the level of diabetic retinopathy (DR) severity. We also present and compare simple transfer learning-based approaches using established networks such as AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet, Inception-v3, NASNet, DenseNet, and GoogLeNet for DR detection. For the grading stage (mild, moderate, proliferative, or severe), we present an approach of combining various convolutional neural networks with principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction and a support vector machine classifier. We study the performance of these networks under different preprocessing conditions. Results: We compare these results with various existing state-of-the-art approaches, which include single-stage architectures.We demonstrate that this architecture is more robust to limited training data and class imbalance. We achieve an accuracy of 98.4% for DR detection and an accuracy of 96.3% for distinguishing severity of DR, thereby setting a benchmark for future research efforts using a limited set of training images. Conclusions: Results obtained using the proposed approach serve as a benchmark for future research efforts. We demonstrate as a proof-of-concept that an automated detection and grading system could be developed with a limited set of images and labels.

Early detection of security issues is one of the key measures to prevent security incidents. Security bug report prediction (SBR) can help developers identify hidden security issues in the bug tracking system and fix them as early as possible. However, since the number of security bug reports in real software projects is small, and the features are complex (i.e., there are many types of security vulnerabilities with different types of features), this makes the manual extraction of security features relatively difficult and lead to low accuracy of security bug report prediction with traditional machine learning classification algorithms. To solve this problem, a deep-learning-based security bug report prediction method is proposed. The text mining models TextCNN and TextRNN via deep learning are used to construct security bug report prediction models. For extracting textual features of security bug reports, the Skip-Gram method is used to construct a word embedding matrix. The constructed model has been empirically evaluated on five classical security bug report datasets with different scales. The results show that the deep learning model is superior to the traditional machine learning classification algorithm in 80% of the experimental cases, and the performance of the constructed models can improve 0.258 on average and 0.535 at most in terms of F1-score performance measure. Furthermore, different re-sampling strategies are applied to deal with class imbalance problem in gathered SBR prediction datasets, and the experiment results are discussed. © Copyright 2020, Institute of Software, the Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In order to improve the performance of classification, a Group-Label-Specific Features Learning method based on Label-Density Classification Margin (GLSFL-LDCM) is proposed. Firstly, the cosine similarity is used to construct the label correlation matrix, and the class labels are grouped by spectral clustering to extract the label-specific features of each label group to reduce the time consumption for calculating the label-specific features of all class labels. Then, the density of each label is calculated to update the label space matrix, the label-density information is added to the original label space. The classification margin between the positive and negative labels is expanded, thus the imbalance label distribution density problem is effectively solved by the method of label-density classification margin.

In recent years, numerous decision support systems have been developed to deal with smoking cessation based on machine learning methods. However, the inevitable class imbalance is considered a major challenge in deploying such systems. In this paper, we study an empirical comparison of machine learning techniques to deal with the class imbalance problem in the prediction of smoking cessation intervention among the Korean population. For the class imbalance problem, the objective of this paper is to improve the prediction performance based on the utilization of synthetic oversampling techniques, which we called the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) and an adaptive synthetic (ADASYN). This has been achieved by the experimental design, which comprises three components. First, the selection of the best representative features is performed in two phases: the lasso method and multicollinearity analysis. Second, generate the newly balanced data utilizing SMOTE and ADASYN technique. Third, machine learning classifiers are applied to construct the prediction models among all subjects and each gender. In order to justify the effectiveness of the prediction models, the f-score, type I error, type II error, balanced accuracy and geometric mean indices are used. Comprehensive analysis demonstrates that Gradient Boosting Trees (GBT), Random Forest (RF) and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP) classifiers achieved the best performances in all subjects and each gender when SMOTE and ADASYN were utilized. The SMOTE with GBT and RF models also provide feature importance scores that enhance the interpretability of the decision-support system.

The need to prevent these events through the prescription of adequate schemes of antithrombotic prophylaxis has motivated the development of models that aid the identification of patients at higher risk of thrombotic events with lethal consequences. However, antithrombotic prophylaxis increases the risk of bleeding and this risk depends on the class and intensity of the chosen antithrombotic prophylactic scheme, the clinical and personal condition of the patient and the disease characteristics. Moreover, the datasets used to obtain current models are imbalanced, i.e., they incorporate more patients who did not suffer thrombotic events than patients who experienced them what can lead to wrong predictions, especially for the clinically relevant patient group at high risk of thrombosis. Herein, predictive models based on machine learning were developed utilizing 121 high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients, considering the clinical variables of the patients and those typical of the disease. To properly manage the data imbalance, cost-sensitive classification together with multi-objective optimization was performed considering different combinations of metrics. In this way, five Pareto fronts and a series of optimal models with different false positive and false negative rates were obtained. With this novel approach to the development of clinical predictive models, personalized models can be developed, helping the clinician to achieve a better balance between the risk of bleeding and the risk of thrombosis. © 2013 IEEE.","Clinical biomarkers; multi-objective optimization; ovarian cancer; prediction models; venous thromboembolism","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The longstanding shortage of labeled activity data inherently calls for a plethora of semisupervised learning methods, and one of the most challenging and common issues with semisupervised learning is the imbalanced distribution of labeled data over classes. Although the problem has long existed in broad real-world HAR applications, it is rarely explored in the literature. In this paper, we propose a semisupervised deep model for imbalanced activity recognition from multimodal wearable sensory data. We aim to address not only the challenges of multimodal sensor data (e.g., interperson variability and interclass similarity) but also the limited labeled data and class-imbalance issues simultaneously. In particular, we propose a pattern-balanced semisupervised framework to extract and preserve diverse latent patterns of activities. Furthermore, we exploit the independence of multi-modalities of sensory data and attentively identify salient regions that are indicative of human activities from inputs by our recurrent convolutional attention networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves a competitive performance compared to a multitude of state-of-the-art methods, both semisupervised and supervised ones, with 10% labeled training data.

The recent success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in object detection and object segmentation tasks has shown promise in building an automatic deep CNN-based FER model. However, in real-world scenarios, performance degrades dramatically owing to the great diversity of factors unrelated to facial expressions, and due to a lack of training data and an intrinsic imbalance in the existing facial emotion datasets. To tackle these problems, this paper not only applies deep transfer learning techniques, but also proposes a novel loss function called weighted-cluster loss, which is used during the fine-tuning phase. Specifically, the weighted-cluster loss function simultaneously improves the intra-class compactness and the inter-class separability by learning a class center for each emotion class. It also takes the imbalance in a facial expression dataset into account by giving each emotion class a weight based on its proportion of the total number of images. In addition, a recent, successful deep CNN architecture, pre-trained in the task of face identification with the VGGFace2 database from the Visual Geometry Group at Oxford University, is employed and fine-tuned using the proposed loss function to recognize eight basic facial emotions from the AffectNet database of facial expression, valence, and arousal computing in the wild. Experiments on an AffectNet real-world facial dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline CNN models that use either weighted-softmax loss or center loss. © 2020 by the authors.

Although both computer vision and machine learning techniques have constantly been improved to solve this problem, the sudden rise in the number of unlabeled traffic signs has become even more challenging. Large data collation and labeling are tedious and expensive tasks that demand much time, expert knowledge, and fiscal resources to satisfy the hunger of deep neural networks. Aside from that, the problem of having unbalanced data also poses a greater challenge to computer vision and machine learning algorithms to achieve better performance. These problems raise the need to develop algorithms that can fully exploit a large amount of unlabeled data, use a small amount of labeled samples, and be robust to data imbalance to build an efficient and high-quality classifier. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised classification technique that is robust to small and unbalanced data. The framework integrates weakly-supervised learning and self-training with self-paced learning to generate attention maps to augment the training set and utilizes a novel pseudo-label generation and selection algorithm to generate and select pseudo-labeled samples. The method improves the performance by: (1) normalizing the class-wise confidence levels to prevent the model from ignoring hard-to-learn samples, thereby solving the imbalanced data problem; (2) jointly learning a model and optimizing pseudo-labels generated on unlabeled data; and (3) enlarging the training set to satisfy the hunger of deep learning models. Extensive evaluations on two public traffic sign recognition datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique and provide a potential solution for practical applications. © 2020 by the authors.

In agriculture, the intelligent classification of post-harvested fruits seems to have a direct impact on farmers, mainly for export products. Unlike other popular fruits, coconuts tend to have limited studies due to its tropical nature grown in developing countries as well as its unique physical structure. In this study, a classification of real coconut datasets is performed based on acoustic signals acquired through a developed tapping system and learned by three widely-used machine learning techniques - artificial neural network (ANN), random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM). There are 129 coconuts samples, each classified into three maturity levels – pre-mature, mature, and over-mature. A three-second tapping system gathered from each sample a total of 132,300 data points, which underwent noise reduction and signal processing. Each machine learning model predicts the class of the fruit by learning the patterns of the transformed frequency spectrums of each sample signal. Based on ten times cross-validated results, the three machine learning algorithms satisfactorily predicted the maturity level of coconuts with at least 80% classification accuracy. All models correctly predicted over-mature coconuts but confused in classifying pre-mature with mature and mature with over-mature coconuts. RF model outperformed the other models with efficiencies of 90.98% and 83.48% accuracies for training and testing, respectively. The imbalance data for each coconut class can be addressed to give better results. Additionally, the prepared coconut dataset may use more advanced deep learning techniques. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Acoustic signal; Coconut; Fruit classification; Intelligent systems; Machine learning","Elsevier B.V."

However, the exponential growth in the genomic and drugs data makes it difficult to identify the new associations between drugs and targets. Therefore, we use computational methods as it helps in accelerating the DTI identification process. Usually, available data driven sources consisting of known DTI is used to train the classifier to predict the new DTIs. Such datasets often face the problem of class imbalance. Therefore, in this study we address two challenges faced by such datasets, i. e., class imbalance and high dimensionality to develop a predictive model for DTI prediction. The study is carried out on four protein classes namely Enzyme, Ion Channel, G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR) and Nuclear Receptor. We encoded the target protein sequence using the dipeptide composition and drug with a molecular descriptor. A machine learning approach is employed to predict the DTI using wrapper feature selection and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). The ensemble approach achieved at the best an accuracy of 95.9 %, 93.4 %, 90.8 % and 90.6 % and 96.3 %, 92.8 %, 90.1 %, and 90.2 % of precision on Enzyme, Ion Channel, GPCR and Nuclear Receptor datasets, respectively, when evaluated excluding SMOTE samples with 10-fold cross validation. Furthermore, our method could predict new drug-target interactions not contained in training dataset. Selected features using wrapper feature selection may be important to understand the DTI for the protein categories under this study. Based on our evaluation, the proposed method can be used for understanding and identifying new drug-target interactions. We provide the readers with a standalone package available at https://github.com/shwetagithub1/predDTI which will be able to provide the DTI predictions to user for new query DTI pairs. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This necessitates the investigation of the significance of both types of data in prediction of injury severity using ML techniques. In addition, the unstructured texts, and class-imbalance in data often create difficulty in analysis. Therefore, to address the above-mentioned issues, two types of data, namely investigation report (i.e., reactive data) and inspection report (i.e., proactive data), collected from a steel plant, are used in this study. The datasets are merged together for generating mixed dataset. Topic modeling is used to handle the unstructured texts. A total of four oversampling algorithms, namely Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), borderline SMOTE (BLSMOTE), Majority Weighted Minority Oversampling Technique (MWMOTE), and k-means SMOTE (KMSMOTE) have been used separately to handle the class imbalance issue. Thereafter, a set of six prediction algorithms, namely support vector machine, artificial neural network, Naíve Bayes, k-nearest neighbour, classification and regression tree analysis, and random forest have been used on reactive and mixed datasets separately for injury severity prediction. The results reveal that KMSMOTE performs better than others in balancing datasets and therefore, helps in achieving higher prediction in terms of average recall, F1-score and geometric mean. In addition, it is also statistically shown that prediction of injury severity is significantly higher using mixed dataset than reactive dataset only.

Otherwise, the accuracy estimates may be unreliable and classes with only a few values are often misclassified or neglected. This is known as a class imbalance problem in machine learning and datasets that do not meet this criterion are referred to as imbalanced data. Most datasets of soil classes are, therefore, imbalanced data. One of our main objectives is to compare eight resampling strategies that have been developed to counteract the imbalanced data problem. We compared the performance of five of the most common ML algorithms with the resampling approaches. The highest increase in prediction accuracy was achieved with SMOTE (the synthetic minority oversampling technique). In comparison to the baseline prediction on the original dataset, we achieved an increase of about 10, 20 and 10% in the overall accuracy, kappa index and F-score, respectively. Regarding the ML approaches, random forest (RF) showed the best performance with an overall accuracy, kappa index and F-score of 66, 60 and 57%, respectively. Moreover, the combination of RF and SMOTE improved the accuracy of the individual soil classes, compared to RF trained on the original dataset and allowed better prediction of soil classes with a low number of samples in the corresponding soil profile database, in our case for Chernozems. Our results show that balancing existing soil legacy data using synthetic sampling strategies can significantly improve the prediction accuracy in digital soil mapping (DSM). Highlights: Spatial distribution of soil classes in Iran can be predicted using machine learning (ML) algorithms. The synthetic minority oversampling technique overcomes the drawback of imbalanced and highly biased soil legacy data. When combining a random forest model with synthetic sampling strategies the prediction accuracy of the soil model improves significantly. The resulting new soil map of Iran has a much higher spatial resolution compared to existing maps and displays new soil classes that have not yet been mapped in Iran. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","covariates; imbalanced data; machine learning; random forest; soil legacy data","Blackwell Publishing Ltd"

Most literature deals with small academic datasets, so that results often do not extrapolate to the large real-life datasets, or have little real-life validity. When minority class sample generation by interpolation is meaningless, the recourse to undersampling the majority class is mandatory in order to reach some acceptable results. Ensembles of classifiers provide the advantage of the diversity of their members, which may allow adaptation to the imbalanced distribution. In this paper, we present a pipeline method combining random undersampling with bootstrap aggregation (bagging) for a hybrid ensemble of extreme learning machines and decision trees, whose diversity improves adaptation to the imbalanced class dataset. The approach is demonstrated on a realistic greatly imbalanced dataset of emergency department patients from a Chilean hospital targeted to predict patient readmission.

In healthcare, mental health is gaining more and more space. The diagnosis of mental disorders is based upon standardized patient interviews with defined set of questions and scales which is a time consuming and costly process. Our objective was to apply the machine learning model and to evaluate to see if there is predictive power of biomarkers data to enhance the diagnosis of depression cases. In this research paper, we aimed to explore the detection of depression cases among the sample of 11,081 Dutch citizen dataset. Most of the earlier studies have balanced datasets wherein the proportion of healthy cases and unhealthy cases are equal but in our study, the dataset contains only 570 cases of self-reported depression out of 11,081 cases hence it is a class imbalance classification problem. The machine learning model built on imbalance dataset gives predictions biased toward majority class hence the model will always predict the case as no depression case even if it is a case of depression. We used different resampling strategies to address the class imbalance problem. We created multiple samples by under sampling, over sampling, over-under sampling and ROSE sampling techniques to balance the dataset and then, we applied machine learning algorithm “Extreme Gradient Boosting” (XGBoost) on each sample to classify the mental illness cases from healthy cases. The balanced accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score obtained from over-sampling and over-under sampling were more than 0.90.

Fraud in credit card is increasing manifold. Such frauds are serious issues currently in the industry and cause huge damage. are costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive tasks. Consumers and financial companies pay very high cost amounting to billions of dollars yearly due to frauds, and fraudsters are on the go to find newer ways and techniques to commit unlawful actions, continuously. Definition of credit card can be given by the physical loss of credit card or loss of sensitive credit card information. As these frauds are increasing very fast we need efficient methods like Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to tackle them. Various challenges include unpublished literature and an imbalance classification. Here, in paper we suggest to add a new module of face recognition and detection as a confirmatory test in case of doubtful transactions. Fraud detection are combination of number activities performed to avoid money from being stollen or taken by illegal or untrue instances. In banking, fraud activities involve forging of cheques or misusing robbed or stollen credit cards. In the paper, the focus is on frauds of credit card and to understand how classifier algorithms are performing. We would be considering sampling the data using various algorithms and performing a comparative analysis on the results of classifiers post sampling. Resultant, we hope to retrieve a classification algorithm working best with a particular sampling methodology dependent on the dataset and parameters provided. Lastly, addition of a face recognition model is performed to act as a confirmatory test in case of fraud detection by the classifier. © 2020 SERSC.","Class imbalance; Classification algorithms; Face recognition; Fraud","Science and Engineering Research Support Society"

Most of the real world problems including credit card transaction frauds, disease prediction and so on have huge data instances but the number of positive instances in those datasets is far lesser than the number of negative instances. Suppose 99% of the data tuples come from the majority class but only 1% of the instances are from the minority class, and our classifier classifies each data tuple as majority instance, then the accuracy of our model will of course be 99% but this classifier is of no use as it doesn’t detect any minority instance which is the main purpose of the classifier. This is why the data needs to be balanced first in order to train our classifiers. The balanced data can now be used to train our classification model. There are so many classification algorithms present, and each of them has their own pros and cons. So, in order to achieve higher accuracy and better results various individual classification algorithms including Naive Bayes, Decision Trees and Random Forests are used.

Many researchers have built a software bug prediction (SBP) model, which classify faulty and non-faulty module which are associated with software metrics. Till now very few works has been done which addresses the class imbalance problem in SBP. The main objective of this paper is to reveal the favorable result by feature selection and machine learning methods to detect defective and non-defective software modules. We propose a rudimentary classification based framework Bug Prediction using Deep representation and Ensemble learning (BPDET) techniques for SBP. It combinedly applies by ensemble learning (EL) and deep representation(DR). The software metrics which are used for SBP are mostly conventional. Staked denoising auto-encoder (SDA) is used for the deep representation of software metrics, which is a robust feature learning method. Propose model is mainly divided into two stages: deep learning stage and two layers of EL stage (TEL). The extraction of the feature from SDA in the very first step of the model then applied TEL in the second stage. TEL is also dealing with the class imbalance problem. The experiment mainly performed NASA (12) datasets, to reveal the efficiency of DR, SDA, and TEL. The performance is analyzed in terms of Mathew co-relation coefficient (MCC), the area under the curve (AUC), precision-recall area (PRC), F-measure and Time. Out of 12 dataset MCC values over 11 datasets, ROC values over 6 datasets, PRC values overall 12 datasets and F-measure over 8 datasets surpass the existing state of the art bug prediction methods.

Designing an efficient framework for CCFD is particularly challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of positive and negative classes in data. Conventional works overlook hidden transaction patterns and the performance evaluation methods of algorithm or system. The early models have also been criticized for over-fitting, i.e. models having less prediction accuracy than training or classification accuracy. However, the categorical accuracy is more important than overall accuracy for extremely imbalanced data; most of the previous works do not evaluate their model on the basis of categorical accuracy. In this work, we propose a predictive framework (DEAL) based on novel Deep Ensemble Learning for detecting fraudulent transaction in real-time data stream. The proposed framework is adaptive against data imbalance and robust against latent transaction patterns such as spending behavior. To build the model and predict the fraud, the transactions from real data from a major bank are passed as tensors to ensemble of Deep Learning Network. The adaptive optimization is suggested to minimize the objective function and improve fraud prediction. All Experiments are conducted in Python using scikit-learn, Google TensorFlow, and Keras Deep Learning libraries.

Conventional statistical crash prediction models frequently suffer from severe data quality issues and require a significant amount of historical data. On the other hand, even though machine learning (ML) based algorithms have proven to be powerful in predicting future outcomes in different fields of applications, they likely fail to provide satisfactory results unless a tuning parameter approach is conducted. The main objective of this article is to develop real-time crash prediction models that will potentially be employed within traffic management systems. Methods: In this study, two highly optimized data-driven models for crash occurrence prediction have been designed based on the popular machine learning techniques, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and deep neural network Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). To ensure that the proposed algorithms produce robust and stable performance, the optimal scheme for models’ construction has been thoroughly examined and discussed. Additionally, the further boost of models’ performance requires the systemic assessment of crash strongest precursors within the driver-vehicle-environment triptych. Therefore, three categories of features, including driver input responses, vehicle kinematics and weather conditions, were measured during the execution of various driving tasks performed on a desktop driving simulator. Moreover, since crash events typically occur in rare instances tending to be underrepresented in the dataset, an imbalance-aware strategy to overcome the issue was adopted using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE). Results: The results show that MLP exhibited the best performing prediction results, most particularly, in clear, overcast and snow conditions, in which MLP recall values were above 94%. Higher F1-score values were achieved in overcast and rain weather by MLP and snow conditions by SVM; whereas over 90% of G-mean levels were obtained under fog and rain conditions for MLP and snow condition for SVM. Conclusion: The findings provide new insights into crash events forecasting and may be used to promote enforcement efforts related to designing crash avoidance/warning systems that enhance the effectiveness of the system’s application based on driver input and vehicle kinematics under various weather conditions. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Crash prediction; driving simulator; machine learning; multilayer perceptron; SMOTE; support vector machine","Taylor and Francis Inc."

With the development of the Internet, online applications and in the following encrypted techniques, encrypted traffic has changed to a major challenge for traffic classification. In fact, unbalanced data, in which the unbalanced distribution of samples across classes lead to the classification performance reduction, is considered as one of the prominent challenges in encrypted traffic classification. Although previous studies tried to deal with the class imbalance problem in the pre-processing step using machine learning and particularly deep learning models, they are still confronting with some limitations. In this regard, a new classification method is proposed in this paper that tries to deal with the problem of unbalanced data during the training process. The proposed method employs a cost-sensitive convolution neural network and considers a cost for each classification according to the distribution of classes. These costs are then applied to the network along the training process to enhance the overall accuracy. Based on the empirical results, the proposed model obtained higher classification performance (about 2% on average) compared to the Deep Packet method. © 2020 IEEE.","Convolutional Neural Network; Cost-Sensitive Learning; Deep Learning; Encrypted Traffic; Web Traffic Classification","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The rising big data era has been witnessing more classification tasks with large-scale but extremely imbalance and low-quality datasets. Most of existing learning methods suffer from poor performance or low computation efficiency under such a scenario. To tackle this problem, we conduct deep investigations into the nature of class imbalance, which reveals that not only the disproportion between classes, but also other difficulties embedded in the nature of data, especially, noises and class overlapping, prevent us from learning effective classifiers. Taking those factors into consideration, we propose a novel framework for imbalance classification that aims to generate a strong ensemble by self-paced harmonizing data hardness via under-sampling. Extensive experiments have shown that this new framework, while being very computationally efficient, can lead to robust performance even under highly overlapping classes and extremely skewed distribution. Note that, our methods can be easily adapted to most of existing learning methods (e.g., C4.5, SVM, GBDT and Neural Network) to boost their performance on imbalanced data. © 2020 IEEE.","Data re-sampling; Ensemble learning; Imbalance classification; Imbalance learning","IEEE Computer Society"

However, efforts for wildlife protection are constrained by the limited resources of law enforcement agencies. To help combat poaching, the Protection Assistant for Wildlife Security (PAWS) is a machine learning pipeline that has been developed as a data-driven approach to identify areas at high risk of poaching throughout protected areas and compute optimal patrol routes. In this paper, we take an end-to-end approach to the data-to-deployment pipeline for anti-poaching. In doing so, we address challenges including extreme class imbalance (up to 1:200), bias, and uncertainty in wildlife poaching data to enhance PAWS, and we apply our methodology to three national parks with diverse characteristics. (i) We use Gaussian processes to quantify predictive uncertainty, which we exploit to improve robustness of our prescribed patrols and increase detection of snares by an average of 30%. We evaluate our approach on real-world historical poaching data from Murchison Falls and Queen Elizabeth National Parks in Uganda and, for the first time, Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary in Cambodia. (ii) We present the results of large-scale field tests conducted in Murchison Falls and Srepok Wildlife Sanctuary which confirm that the predictive power of PAWS extends promisingly to multiple parks.

To solve these problems, we developed an active balancing mechanism (ABM) based on valuable information contained in the biomedical data. ABM adopts the Gaussian naïve Bayes method to estimate the object samples and entropy as a query function to evaluate sample information and only retains valuable samples of the majority class to achieve under-sampling. The Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt diagnostic electrocardiogram (ECG) database, including 5,173 normal ECG samples and 26,654 myocardial infarction ECG samples, is applied to verify the validity of ABM. At imbalance rates of 13 and 5, experimental results reveal that ABM takes 7.7 seconds and 13.2 seconds, respectively. Both results are significantly faster than five conventional under-sampling methods. In addition, at the imbalance rate of 13, ABM-based data obtained the highest accuracy of 92.23% and 97.52% using support vector machines and modified convolutional neural networks (MCNNs) with eight layers, respectively. At the imbalance rate of 5, the processed data by ABM also achieved the best accuracy of 92.31% and 98.46% based on support vector machines and MCNNs, respectively. Furthermore, ABM has better performance than two compared methods in F1-measure, G-means, and area under the curve. Consequently, ABM could be a useful and effective approach to deal with imbalanced data in general, particularly biomedical myocardial infarction ECG datasets, and the MCNN can also achieve higher performance compared to the state of the art. © 2020 ACM.","Biomedical; entropy; Gaussian naïve Bayes; imbalanced data; myocardial infarction","Association for Computing Machinery"

In recent years, ADHD classification based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data has become a research hotspot. Most existing classification algorithms reported in the literature assume that samples are balanced; however, ADHD data sets are usually imbalanced. Imbalanced data sets can cause the performance degradation of a classifier by imbalanced learning, which tends to over focus on the majority class. In this study, we considered an imbalanced neuroimaging classification problem: classification of ADHD using resting state fMRI. We used the functional connection matrix of fMRI as the classification feature and proposed a multi-objective data classification scheme based on a support vector machine (SVM) to aid the diagnosis of ADHD. In this scheme, the imbalanced data classification problem is formulated as an SVM model with three objectives: maximizing the margin, minimizing the sum of positive errors, and minimizing the sum of negative errors. Accordingly, the positive and negative sample empirical errors can be separately handled. Then, the model is solved by a multi-objective optimization method, i.e., normal boundary intersection method. A set of representative classifiers are computed for selection by decision makers. The proposed scheme was tested and evaluated on five data sets from the ADHD-200 consortium and compared with traditional classification methods. Experimental results show that the proposed three-objective SVM classification scheme is better than traditional classification methods reported in the literature. It can effectively address the data imbalance problem from the algorithm level. This scheme can be used in the diagnosis of ADHD as well as other diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Autism. © All right reserved.","Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Imbalance data set; Multi-objective optimization; Support vector machine","Science Press"

This study aims to address the concept drift, which is a major challenge in the processing of voluminous data streams. Concept drift refers to overtime change in data distribution. It may occur in the medical domain, for example the medical sensors measuring for general healthcare or rehabilitation, which may switch their roles for ICU emergency operations when required. Detecting concept drifts becomes trickier when the class distributions in data are skewed, which is often true for medical sensors e-health data. Reactive Drift Detection Method (RDDM) is an efficient method for detecting long concepts. However, RDDM has a high error rate, and it does not handle class imbalance. We propose an Enhanced Reactive Drift Detection Method (ERDDM), which systematically generates strategies to handle concept drift with class imbalance in data streams. We conducted experiments to compare ERDDM with three contemporary techniques in terms of prediction error, drift detection delay, latency, and ability to handle data imbalance. The experimentation was done in Massive Online Analysis (MOA) on 48 synthetic datasets customized to possess the capabilities of data streams.

Analyzing and extracting knowledge from such big datasets are a very challenging task due to the imbalance of data distribution, which could lead to a biased classification results and wrong decisions. The standard classifiers are not capable of handling such datasets. Hence, a new technique for dealing with such datasets is required. This paper proposes a novel classification framework for big data that consists of three developed phases. The first phase is the feature selection phase, which uses the Whale optimization algorithm (WOA) for finding the best set of features. The second phase is the preprocessing phase, which uses the SMOTE algorithm and the LSH-SMOTE algorithm for solving the class imbalance problem. Lastly, the third phase is WOA + BRNN algorithm, which is using the Whale optimization algorithm for training a deep learning approach called bidirectional recurrent neural network for the first time.

The previous works apply the clustering as a pre-processing tool, by classifying samples to clusters for simplicity of the following manual risk level rating or failure prediction. In contrast, this work proposes a method based on clustering and statistical test for evaluating risk state via small volume of historical failure records.

This bias may exist due to three reasons: (1) Classification systems are often optimized and compared using performance measurements that are unsuitable for imbalance problems; (2) most learning algorithms are designed and tested on a fixed imbalance level of data, which may differ from operational scenarios; (3) the preference of correct classification of classes is different from one application to another. This paper investigates specialized performance evaluation metrics and tools for imbalance problem, including scalar metrics that assume a given operating condition (skew level and relative preference of classes), and global evaluation curves or metrics that consider a range of operating conditions. We focus on the case in which the scalar metric F-measure is preferred over other scalar metrics, and propose a new global evaluation space for the F-measure that is analogous to the cost curves for expected cost. In this space, a classifier is represented as a curve that shows its performance over all of its decision thresholds and a range of possible imbalance levels for the desired preference of true positive rate to precision. Curves obtained in the F-measure space are compared to those of existing spaces (ROC, precision-recall and cost) and analogously to cost curves. The proposed F-measure space allows to visualize and compare classifiers’ performance under different operating conditions more easily than in ROC and precision-recall spaces. This space allows us to set the optimal decision threshold of a soft classifier and to select the best classifier among a group. This space also allows to empirically improve the performance obtained with ensemble learning methods specialized for class imbalance, by selecting and combining the base classifiers for ensembles using a modified version of the iterative Boolean combination algorithm that is optimized using the F-measure instead of AUC. Experiments on a real-world dataset for video face recognition show the advantages of evaluating and comparing different classifiers in the F-measure space versus ROC, precision-recall, and cost spaces.

The frailty accompanying the late years of elderly people (>70 years old) deserves special consideration due to its great economical and personal costs and the workload imposed on the health care system. Hospital readmissions under a short time after hospital discharge are one of the sources of concern, and much effort is being devoted to their prediction for better care of the elder and optimized resource management. In this paper, we consider the prediction of readmissions for patients that are evaluated positively in the frailty scales. The computational experiments are carried out over a gender-balanced cohort of 645 patients recruited at the University Hospital of Alava. We report machine-learning prediction results of the readmission before the standard readmission limit of 30 days. We apply an upsampling technique to correct for class imbalance.

The traditional candidate selection is heavily dependent on human inspection. However, the human inspection is a subjective, time consuming, and error-prone process. A modern radio telescopes pulsar survey project can produce totally millions of candidates, so the manual selection becomes extremely difficult and inefficient due to a large number of candidates. Therefore, this study focuses on machine learning developed in recent years. In order to improve the efficiency of pulsar candidate selection, we propose a candidate selection method based on self-normalizing neural networks. This method uses three techniques: self-normalizing neural networks, genetic algorithm and synthetic minority over-sampling technique. The self-normalizing neural networks can improve the identification accuracy by applying deep neural networks to pulsar candidate selection. At the same time, it solves the problem of gradient disappearance and explosion in the training process of deep neural networks by using its self-normalizing property, which greatly accelerates the training process. In addition, in order to eliminate the redundancy of the sample data, we use genetic algorithm to choose sample features of pulsar candidates. The genetic algorithm for feature selection can be summarized into three steps: initializing population, assessing population fitness, and generating new populations. Decoding the individual with the largest fitness value in the last generation population, we can obtain the best subset of features. Due to radio frequency interference or noise, there are a large number of non-pulsar signals in candidates, and only a few real pulsar signals exist there. Aiming at solving the severe class imbalance problem, we use the synthetic minority over-sampling technique to increase the pulsar candidates (minority class) and reduce the imbalance degree of data. By using k-nearest neighbor and linear interpolation to insert a new sample between two minority classes of samples that are close to each other according to certain rules, we can prevent the classifier from becoming biased towards the abundant non-pulsar class (majority class). Experimental results on three pulsar candidate datasets show that the self-normalizing neural network has higher accuracy and faster convergence speed than the traditional artificial neural network in the deep structure, By using the genetic algorithm and synthetic minority over-sampling technique, the selection performance of pulsar candidates can be effectively improved. © 2020 Chinese Physical Society.","Class imbalance; Feature selection; Pulsar candidate selection; Self-normalizing neural networks","Institute of Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences"

This work proposes a framework to deal with these issues, such as competing objectives and class imbalance in designing a machine vision system for the in-line detection of surface defects on glass substrates of thin-film transistor liquid crystal displays (TFT-LCDs). The developed inspection system composes of (i) feature engineering: extraction of only the defect-relevant features from images using two-dimensional wavelet decomposition and (ii) training ensemble classifiers (proof of concept with a C5.0 ensemble, random forests (RF), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost)). The focus is on cost sensitivity, increased generalization, and robustness to handle class imbalance and address multiple competing manufacturing objectives. Comprehensive performance evaluation was conducted in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) by calculating their 12,000 bootstrapped estimates. Results revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) between the three developed diagnostic algorithms. RFR (accuracy of 83.37%, sensitivity of 60.62%, specificity of 89.72%, and MCC of 0.51) outperformed both AdaBoost (accuracy of 81.14%, sensitivity of 69.23%, specificity of 84.48%, and MCC of 0.50) and the C5.0 ensemble (accuracy of 78.35%, sensitivity of 65.35%, specificity of 82.03%, and MCC of 0.44) in all the metrics except sensitivity. AdaBoost exhibited stronger performance in detecting defective TFT-LCD glass substrates. These promising results demonstrated that the proposed ensemble approach is a viable alternative to manual inspections when applied to an industrial case study with issues such as competing objectives and class imbalance.

There is an exponential increase in terms of the effort required to remove bugs due to design flaws in cases where the flaws are not detected in the early stages of the development of the software.

There are many ways of attempting to illegal use of electricity like by-passing and reversing meters. There have been many attempts to bring down NTL using manual and automated techniques. Manual NTL detection is not proving fruitful as it incurs heavy costs and has a low hit ratio. Due to the shortcoming of manual NTL detection, automated detection of NTL using machine learning classifiers is gaining attention in the research community. The datasets containing NTL belong to the class imbalance domain where regular consumers (negative class) out weight the representation of irregular consumers (positive class). To identify the right number of representative records, many techniques are proposed but selecting the right features in deciding NTL is equally an important task where not much has been contributed to the literature. In this paper, we propose the Incremental Feature Selection (IFS) algorithm which first uses feature importance to identify the most relevant features for NTL detection and then these features are used to test three classifiers namely CatBoost, Decision Tree (DT) Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for NTL detection. This way, we have not only identified the most relevant features for NTL detection in a real dataset but also have brought down the overall computation time of the classifiers. Moreover, our proposed framework is tested on three performance evaluation metrics used in imbalance domain. The results show that using the most relevant features identified by the IFS algorithm, the three classifiers have the same or slightly better efficiency as compared to using all features. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Due to the rarity of AD and the complexity of symptoms, many doctors have no clinical experience with it. Many patients are not suspected of having AD, which lead to a high rate of misdiagnosis. Here, we report the preliminary study and feasibility of rapid and accurate screening method of AD with machine learning methods. Methods: The dataset analyzed was composed by examination data provided by the Xiangya Hospital Central South University of China which include a total of 60,000 samples, including aortic patients and non-aortic ones. Each sample has 76 features which is consist of routine examinations and other easily accessible information. Since the proportion of people who are affected is usually imbalanced compared to non-diseased people, multiple machine learning models were used, include AdaBoost, SmoteBagging, EasyEnsemble and CalibratedAdaMEC. They used different methods such as ensemble learning, undersampling, oversampling, and cost-sensitivity to solve data imbalance problems. Results: AdaBoost performed poorly with an average recall of 16.1% and a specificity of 99.8%. SmoteBagging achieved a statistically significant better performance for this problem with an average recall of 78.1% and a specificity of 79.2%. EasyEnsemble reached the values of 77.8% and 79.3% for recall and specificity respectively. CalibratedAdaMEC’s recall and specificity are 75.8% and 76%. Conclusions: It was found that the screening performance of the models evaluated in this paper had a misdiagnosis rate lower than 25% except AdaBoost. The data used in these methods are only routine inspection data. This means that machine learning methods can help us build a fast, cheap, worthwhile and effective early screening approach for AD. © Journal of Thoracic Disease.

ML techniques are used for the analysis of clinical parameters and their combinations for prognosis, therapy planning and support and patient management and wellbeing. In this research, we investigate a crucial problem associated with medical applications such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) data imbalances in which cases are far more than just controls in the dataset. In autism diagnosis data, the number of possible instances is linked with one class, i.e. the no ASD is larger than the ASD, and this may cause performance issues such as models favouring the majority class and undermining the minority class. This research experimentally measures the impact of class imbalance issue on the performance of different classifiers on real autism datasets when various data imbalance approaches are utilised in the pre-processing phase. We employ oversampling techniques, such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling (SMOTE), and undersampling with different classifiers including Naive Bayes, RIPPER, C4.5 and Random Forest to measure the impact of these on the performance of the models derived in terms of area under curve and other metrics. Results pinpoint that oversampling techniques are superior to undersampling techniques, at least for the toddlers' autism dataset that we consider, and suggest that further work should look at incorporating sampling techniques with feature selection to generate models that do not overfit the dataset. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Co.","ASD screening; Autism spectrum disorder; data imbalance; machine learning; oversampling; SMOTE; undersampling","World Scientific Publishing Co.

Therefore, class labels in MLC are not mutual exclusive as in single label classification (SLC). Consequently, the search space of the MLC problem is large compared with that of SLC and grows in an exponential way. One main approach to solve MLC problem is through forcing instances to be associated with only one class label. This approach of handling the problem of MLC has been widely known as problem transformation method (PTM). Existing PTMs depend on the frequency of class labels as a transformation criterion, which causes several problems such as imbalance class distribution, complicating the training phase and most importantly decreasing the accuracy of the classification task. Therefore, in this paper, a new PTM is proposed based on the positive local dependencies among labels. The proposed PTM aims to facilitate capturing the most accurate positive dependencies among labels and hence improve the predictive performance of the classification task.

Some data preprocessing methods have been proposed to reduce the imbalance ratio of data sets and combine with the basic classifiers to get better performance. In order to improve the whole classification accuracy, we propose a novel classifier ensemble framework based on K-means and resampling technique (EKR). First, we divide the data samples in the majority class into several sub-clusters using K-means, k-value is determined by Average Silhouette Coefficient, and then adjust the number of data samples of each sub-cluster to be the same as that of the minority classes through resampling technology, after that each adjusted sub-cluster and the minority class are combined into several balanced subsets, the base classifier is trained on each balanced subset separately, and finally integrated into a strong ensemble classifier. In this paper, the extensive experimental results on 16 imbalanced datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed algorithm in terms of multiple evaluation criteria, and EKR can achieve better performance when compared with several classical imbalanced classification algorithms using different data preprocessing methods. © 2020 by the authors.

This paper proposes a method for obtaining photometric redshifts, of both galaxies and quasars, that span the entire redshift range (0 < z< 7) in the SDSS catalogue, using ExtraTreesRegressor, a conventional ML method. Data Release 12, 13 and 14 have been used to increase the number of training samples for high redshifts. The redshift values are first transferred to a logarithmic domain to negate the class imbalance effect. Besides the five photometric magnitudes (u-g-r-i-z) typically employed for such tasks, we have used a total of 30 features including morphological parameters, band overlap magnitudes and adjacent filters’ mean magnitudes, and the less contributing features are eliminated using recursive feature elimination. In this work, we propose a custom scoring metric, redshift-weighted mean squared error to penalize the errors of higher redshift values more. Postprocessing methods are used to compensate the biasing of the model for high redshift values. A uniform test set is used to evaluate the performance in all subranges of labels by splitting the entire range into seven bins of equal width. A large number of other in-state ML models have also been used for comparison, where the proposed method has proved to be much superior in terms of various performance metrics. The mean squared error obtained for the uniform test set is 0.66. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","ExtraTreesRegressor; Feature analysis; Photometry; Redshift; Skewness","Springer"

Identifying adults likely to develop OUD can help public health officials in planning effective intervention strategies. The aim of this paper is to develop a machine learning approach to predict adults at risk for OUD and to identify interactions between various characteristics that increase this risk. Methods: In this approach, a data set was curated using the responses from the 2016 edition of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Using this data set, tree-based classifiers (decision tree and random forest) were trained, while employing downsampling to handle class imbalance. Predictions from the tree-based classifiers were also compared to the results from a logistic regression model. The results from the three classifiers were then interpreted synergistically to highlight individual characteristics and their interplay that pose a risk for OUD. Results: Random forest predicted adults at risk for OUD with remarkable accuracy, with the average area under the Receiver-Operating-Characteristics curve (AUC) over 0.89, even though the prevalence of OUD was only about 1 %. It showed a slight improvement over logistic regression. Logistic regression identified statistically significant characteristics, while random forest ranked the predictors in order of their contribution to OUD prediction. Early initiation of marijuana (before 18 years) emerged as the dominant predictor. Decision trees revealed that early marijuana initiation especially increased the risk if individuals: (i) were between 18–34 years of age, or (ii) had incomes less than $49,000, or (iii) were of Hispanic and White heritage, or (iv) were on probation, or (v) lived in neighborhoods with easy access to drugs. Conclusions: Machine learning can accurately predict adults at risk for OUD, and identify interactions among the factors that pronounce this risk. Curbing early initiation of marijuana may be an effective prevention strategy against opioid addiction, especially in high risk groups. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Machine learning; Marijuana; Opioid Use Disorder; Random forest","Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

A common characteristic of such a market is a lower percentage of defaulted borrowers than non-defaulted borrowers; thus, the sample is class imbalanced. Class imbalance may affect the accuracy of default predictions, as classifiers tend to be biased towards the majority class (good borrowers). We analyse the default prediction performance when combining class rebalancing methods with different regression and machine learning techniques. We also propose to combine multiple probability predictions to improve the predictive performance. The analysis is based on a book of loans (with a three-year term) funded in the 2010–2015 period though the online platform of Lending Club. The results show that some measures of predictive accuracy tend to improve when the scoring models are trained using a rebalanced, rather than an imbalanced sample, except when the extreme gradient boosting approach is applied. Finally, we find that combining multiple probability predictions via regularised logistic regression may help to improve the predictive accuracy. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Class imbalance; Combining multiple probability predictions; Credit risk scoring prediction; Machine learning; Peer-to-peer lending","Elsevier B.V."

One of the common issues that affects raw data is class imbalance problem which refers to imbalanced distribution of values of the response variable. This issue is present in fraud detection, network intrusion detection, medical diagnostics, and a number of other fields where negatively labeled instances significantly outnumber positively labeled instances. Modern machine learning techniques struggle to deal with imbalanced data by focusing on minimizing the error rate for the majority class while ignoring the minority class. The goal of our paper is demonstrate the effects of class imbalance on classification models. Concretely, we study the impact of varying class imbalance ratios on classifier accuracy. By highlighting the precise nature of the relationship between the degree of class imbalance and the corresponding effects on classifier performance we hope to help researchers to better tackle the problem. To this end, we carry out extensive experiments using 10-fold cross validation on a large number of datasets.

The current classification methods commonly rely on features derived from shape, colour, or texture, obtained after image segmentation, but these do not always guarantee the best results. To improve the classification accuracy, this work proposes to further exploit the border-line characteristics of the lesion segmentation mask, by combining gradients with local binary patterns (LBP). In the proposed method, these border-line features are used together with the conventional ones to enhance the performance of skin lesion classification algorithms. When the new features are combined with the classical ones, the experimental results show higher accuracy, which impacts positively the overall performance of the classification algorithms. As the medical image datasets usually present large class imbalance, which results in low sensitivity for the classifiers, the border-line features have a positive impact on this classification metric, as evidenced by the experimental results.

Oversampling methods that inflate the rare class by generating synthetic data are amongst the most popular techniques for resolving class imbalance. However, they concentrate on the characteristics of the minority class and use them to guide the oversampling process. By completely overlooking the majority class, they lose a global view on the classification problem and, while alleviating the class imbalance, may negatively impact learnability by generating borderline or overlapping instances. This becomes even more critical when facing extreme class imbalance, where the minority class is strongly underrepresented and on its own does not contain enough information to conduct the oversampling process. We propose a framework for synthetic oversampling that, unlike existing resampling methods, is robust on cases of extreme imbalance. The key feature of the framework is that it uses the density of the well-sampled majority class to guide the generation process. We demonstrate implementations of the framework using the Mahalanobis distance and a radial basis function. We evaluate over 25 benchmark datasets and show that the framework offers a distinct performance improvement over the existing state-of-the-art in oversampling techniques. © 2019, Crown.","Extreme imbalance; Imbalanced classification; Machine learning; SMOTE; Synthetic oversampling","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

The multi-classification method based on machine learning is an effective way to improve the evaluation objectivity. However, the data imbalance among the samples of different health levels leads to a low classification accuracy. Therefore, a health evaluation model of D5000 system based on RB-XGBoost(Random Balance and eXtreme Gra-dient Boosting) algorithm is proposed. Firstly, in view of the serious imbalance of sample number among eva-luation levels, a hybrid sampling method based on adaptive RB(Random Balance) is proposed. The maximum and minimum sample number among levels are used as the upper and lower limits of sampling interval respectively, and multiple random numbers are generated to undersample or oversample the data of each level, which increases the diversity and decreases the imbalance degree of training data. Then, after training the balanced sample data, sub-models of XGBoost(eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm are established. Considering the consistency of each sub-model's importance, a hard voting method is proposed to integrate all sub-models, and then the evaluation model corresponding to each sub-module of D5000 system is obtained. Finally, according to the hierarchical relationship of the system indicators, a parallel-serial combined calculation method is adopted in the evaluation process. In this way, the overall health evaluation model of D5000 system including 17 RB-XGBoost models is constructed. The experimental results based on eight sets of KEEL multi-class imbalanced datasets show that the average classification accuracy of the proposed method increases by 6.79% at the most and 2.03% on average compared with the existing similar typical algorithms.

For better classification performance, the dataset should have a balanced data distribution by class. If the dataset is imbalanced, that is, one class (minority class) has very fewer data than the other class (majority class); a model has little chance to learn about the minority class, and training is biased to the majority class. As a result, the model tends to classify any input to the majority class and does not handle data of the minority class properly.

Robotic stroke therapy seeks to remedy the limitations of traditional stroke therapy, but it is hampered by incorrect movements during the session. Incorrect usage of muscles, called as compensatory movements, can cause problems that can hamper the recovery of the patients. Thus, there is a need to develop tools to automatically detect compensatory movements to assist patients doing autonomous therapy sessions. Previous studies on automatic detection using depth sensors did not yield satisfactory results. This study explores class imbalance as a possible reason for the low F1-score results on machine learning classifiers. Different methods to address class imbalance were employed to improve and to analyze the performance of the classifiers. The methods employed allowed the classifiers to sometimes detect compensatory movements however this degraded the performance of detecting the correct movements. Adjusting the decision thresholds of outlier detection algorithms shows this explicitly. Since addressing class imbalance only marginally improves the performance of the classifiers, other possible methods can be explored in conjunction with it. This study shows the possibility of detecting compensations in stroke patients. © 2020 IEEE.","imbalance dataset; imbalanced learning; machine learning; outlier detection; posture classification; stroke rehabilitation","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

In recent years, the malicious behavior of social network spammers has seriously threatened the information security of ordinary users. To reduce this threat, many researchers have mined the behavior characteristics of spammers and have obtained good results by applying machine learning algorithms to identify spammers in social networks. However, most of these studies overlook class imbalance situations that exist in real world data. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous stacking-based ensemble learning framework to ameliorate the impact of class imbalance on spam detection in social networks. The proposed framework consists of two main components, a base module and a combining module. In the base module, we adopt six different base classifiers and utilize this classifier diversity to construct new ensemble input members. In the combination module, we introduce cost sensitive learning into deep neural network training. By setting different costs for misclassification and dynamically adjusting the weights of the prediction results of the base classifiers, we can integrate the input members and aggregate the classification results. The experimental results show that our framework effectively improves the spam detection rate on imbalanced datasets. © 2020 by the authors.","Class imbalance; Cost-sensitive learning; Ensemble learning; Online social networks; Spam detection","MDPI AG"

Nowadays, in the time of big data and deep learning, this problem remains in force. Much work has been performed to deal to the class imbalance problem, the random sampling methods (over and under sampling) being the most widely employed approaches. Moreover, sophisticated sampling methods have been developed, including the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), and also they have been combined with cleaning techniques such as Editing Nearest Neighbor or Tomek's Links (SMOTE+ENN and SMOTE+TL, respectively). In the big data context, it is noticeable that the class imbalance problem has been addressed by adaptation of traditional techniques, relatively ignoring intelligent approaches. Thus, the capabilities and possibilities of heuristic sampling methods on deep learning neural networks in big data domain are analyzed in this work, and the cleaning strategies are particularly analyzed. This study is developed on big data, multi-class imbalanced datasets obtained from hyper-spectral remote sensing images. The effectiveness of a hybrid approach on these datasets is analyzed, in which the dataset is cleaned by SMOTE followed by the training of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with those data, while the neural network output noise is processed with ENN to eliminate output noise; after that, the ANN is trained again with the resultant dataset. Obtained results suggest that best classification outcome is achieved when the cleaning strategies are applied on an ANN output instead of input feature space only. Consequently, the need to consider the classifier's nature when the classical class imbalance approaches are adapted in deep learning and big data scenarios is clear. © 2020 by the authors.","Big data; Hyper-spectral remote sensing images; Multi-class imbalance problem; Sampling methods","MDPI AG"

The improvement effort necessitates reliable prediction models which can identify high-risk patients effectively and enable healthcare practitioners to take a strategic approach. Using predictive analytics based on electronic health record (EHR) for hospital readmission is faced with multiple challenges such as high dimensionality and event sparsity of medical codes and the class imbalance. To response to these challenges, an analytical framework is proposed by data-driven approaches using hospital inpatient administrative data from a nationwide healthcare dataset. A joint ensemble-learning model, which combines the modified weight boosting algorithm with stacking algorithm, is developed and validated. Our study first explores the effects of different feature engineering methods, which effectively handles the challenge of medical vector representation and medical vector sparsity. Secondly, ensemble learning with the proposed modified weight boosting algorithm is used to tackle the class imbalance problem and improve predictability. Finally, we provide various misclassification costs by setting different weights for each class during model training. Using the framework with the proposed modified weight boosting algorithm improves overall model performance by 22.7% and recall from 0.726 to the highest of 0.891 comparing to the benchmark models.

Automatic identification of heavy minerals using classifiers trained by identified minerals has become a topical issue in applying machine learning techniques to geological research. Due to the high cost of manual identification and annotation, the available identified heavy minerals from a single river basin are insufficient for training a classifier with acceptable accuracy. Besides, since there are scores of heavy mineral classes in nature, the common “One vs. One” and “One vs. Rest” strategies used for multi-class classification will cause the problems of class imbalance and time overhead in the case of identifying heavy minerals. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Task Multi-Class learning method (MTMC), which leverages the correlation among heavy minerals collected from multiple river basins, and jointly handles these identification tasks, in order to deal with the problem of insufficient identified heavy minerals from a single river basin while improve the performance of the identification of heavy minerals in all the river basins. MTMC uses softmax as the classifier to handle the multi-class classification of heavy minerals, and formalizes the multi-task learning as a convex optimization problem. The experimental results based on heavy minerals collected from the Yangtse River, Yarlung Zangbo River and PumQu River demonstrate the effectiveness of MTMC, which evidently outperforms current machine learning methods for the identification of heavy minerals. © 2019","Group sparsity; Heavy mineral identification; Multi-class classification; Multi-task learning; River sand","Elsevier Ltd"

To detect unseen malicious traffic, we proposed a linguistic-based detection method for proxy logs. This method extracts words as feature vectors automatically with natural language techniques, and discriminates between benign traffic and malicious traffic. The previous method generates a corpus from all the extracted words which contain trivial words. To generate discriminative feature representation, a corpus has to be effectively summarized. In actual proxy logs, benign traffic is dominant, and occupies malicious feature representation. Hence, the imbalance between benign and malicious traffic occurs. Moreover, a malicious paragraph might be mixed with some benign proxy logs. Therefore, the previous method does not perform accuracy in practical environment. This paper demonstrates that our previous method is not effective in actual proxy logs because of the imbalance. To mitigate the imbalance, our method adjusts lexical features of actual proxy logs based on the word importance. Our method does not adjust the number of each class such as the traditional sampling techniques. We performed cross-validation and timeline analysis with captured pcap files from Exploit Kit and actual proxy logs.

In mineral prospectivity mapping (MPM), supervised machine learning algorithms, which have advantages in dealing with complex geo-data, usually involve uncertainty resulting from the discretization of continuous evidential maps into arbitrary classes as well as the large data imbalance caused by the rarity of deposit locations. Consequently, the predicted results may be biased. In this paper, a random forest (RF) algorithm based on the bagging technique is used to map the prospectivity of tungsten polymetallic deposits in the Nanling metallogenic belt. Data-driven logistic transformation is employed to obtain continuous evidential maps. Both discretized and continuous evidential maps are used to generate prospectivity models for comparison. To reduce the data imbalance, the under-sampling method and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) are implemented to generate balanced datasets. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and improved prediction-area (P-A) plot are applied to evaluate the prospectivity models. The predictive results show that when using the RF algorithm in MPM, the application of continuous evidential maps can improve the performance of prospectivity models and reduce the uncertainty resulting from the discretization of evidential maps. The prospectivity model trained with a balanced SMOTE-generated dataset shows the best overall performance for improving the percentage of deposit locations that are correctly predicted and decreasing the percentage of non-deposit locations that are inaccurately identified as deposit locations to some extent. In addition, the improved P-A plot is superior to the ROC curve because the latter neglects the occupied area, which is critical for mineral exploration and may provide an overly optimistic performance with imbalanced data. However, further testing of the evaluation criteria and the SMOTE approach to reduce data imbalance is warranted to determine fully the universality in MPM from the perspective of data imbalance. Based on prospectivity models, four high-potential areas and five moderate-potential areas are delineated, which indicates good future prospecting for tungsten polymetallic deposits in this region. © 2019, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.","Data imbalance; Improved P-A plot; Mineral prospectivity mapping; Random forest; SMOTE","Springer"

As a representative method, Ranking Support Vector Machine (Rank-SVM) aims to minimize the Ranking Loss and can also mitigate the negative influence of the class-imbalance issue. However, due to its stacking-style way for thresholding, it may suffer error accumulation and thus reduces the final classification performance. Binary Relevance (BR) is another typical method, which aims to minimize the Hamming Loss and only needs one-step learning. Nevertheless, it might have the class-imbalance issue and does not take into account label correlations. To address the above issues, we propose a novel multi-label classification model, which joints Ranking support vector machine and Binary Relevance with robust Low-rank learning (RBRL). RBRL inherits the ranking loss minimization advantages of Rank-SVM, and thus overcomes the disadvantages of BR suffering the class-imbalance issue and ignoring the label correlations. Meanwhile, it utilizes the hamming loss minimization and one-step learning advantages of BR, and thus tackles the disadvantages of Rank-SVM including another thresholding learning step. Besides, a low-rank constraint is utilized to further exploit high-order label correlations under the assumption of low dimensional label space. Furthermore, to achieve nonlinear multi-label classifiers, we derive the kernelization RBRL. Two accelerated proximal gradient methods (APG) are used to solve the optimization problems efficiently.

In contrast, one-stage detectors that are applied over a regular, dense sampling of possible object locations have the potential to be faster and simpler, but have trailed the accuracy of two-stage detectors thus far. In this paper, we investigate why this is the case. We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause. We propose to address this class imbalance by reshaping the standard cross entropy loss such that it down-weights the loss assigned to well-classified examples. Our novel Focal Loss focuses training on a sparse set of hard examples and prevents the vast number of easy negatives from overwhelming the detector during training. To evaluate the effectiveness of our loss, we design and train a simple dense detector we call RetinaNet. Our results show that when trained with the focal loss, RetinaNet is able to match the speed of previous one-stage detectors while surpassing the accuracy of all existing state-of-the-art two-stage detectors.

While a large body of research has been devoted to identifying and recommending POIs, there are few studies on inferring the lifetime status of POIs. Indeed, the predictive analytics of POI lifetime status can be valuable for various tasks, such as urban planning, business site selection, and real estate appraisal. In this article, we propose a multitask learning approach, named inferring POI lifetime status, to inferring the POI lifetime status with multifaceted data sources. Specifically, we first define three types of POI lifetime status, i.e., booming, decaying, and stable. Then,we formulate a serial classification problem to predict the sequential/successive lifetime statuses of POIs over time.

Next, as the booming/decaying POIs are relatively rare in our data, we perform stable class decomposition to alleviate the imbalance between stable POIs and booming/decaying POIs. Finally, we develop a POI lifetime status classifier by exploiting the multitask learning framework as well as the multiclass kernel-based vector machines. We perform extensive experiments using large-scale and real-world datasets of New York City. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach to automatically inferring POI lifetime status. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.","Lifetime status; Multiclass classification; Multitask learning; Point-of-Interest; Urban computing","Association for Computing Machinery"

Nevertheless, the unstable supply of electricity in Cameroon has led to countless periods of electricity load shedding, hence, making the management of the telecom industry to fall on backup power supply such as diesel generators. The fuel consumption of these generators remain a challenge due to some perturbations in the mechanical fuel level gauges and lack of maintenance at the base stations resulting to fuel pilferage. In order to overcome these effects, we detect anomalies in the recorded data by learning the patterns of the fuel consumption using four classification techniques namely; support vector machines (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) and then compare the performance of these classification techniques on a test data. In this paper, we show the use of supervised machine learning classification based techniques in detecting anomalies associated with the fuel consumed dataset from TeleInfra base stations using the generator as a source of power. Here, we perform the normal feature engineering, selection, and then fit the model classifiers to obtain results and finally, test the performance of these classifiers on a test data. The results of this study show that MLP has the best performance in the evaluation measurement recording a score of 96% in the K-fold cross validation test.

This is possible primarily due to two reasons viz. availability of massive amounts of data for analytics, and advancements in hardware in terms of storage and computational power. Healthcare is one such field that is undergoing a major upliftment due to pervasion of DL in a large scale. A wide variety of DL algorithms are being used and being further developed to solve different problems in the healthcare ecosystem. Clinical healthcare is one of the foremost areas in which learning algorithms have been tried to aid decision making. In this direction, combining DL with the existing areas like image processing, natural language processing, virtual reality, etc., has further paved way in automating and improving the quality of clinical healthcare enormously. Such kind of intelligent decision making in healthcare and clinical practice is also expected to result in holistic treatment. In this chapter, we review and accumulate various existing DL techniques and their applications for decision support in clinical systems. There are majorly three application streams of DL namely image analysis, natural language processing, and wearable technology that are discussed in detail. Towards the end of the chapter, a section on directions for future research like handling class imbalance in diagnostic data, DL for prognosis leading to preventive care, data privacy and security would be included.

The provided memes data often face an imbalanced data problem, that is, some classes or labelled sentiment categories significantly outnumber other classes. This often results in difficulty in applying machine learning techniques where balanced labelled input data are required. In this paper, a Gaussian Mixture Model sampling method is proposed to tackle the problem of class imbalance for the memes sentiment classification task. To utilise both text and image data, a multi-modal CNN-LSTM model is proposed to jointly learn latent features for positive, negative and neutral category predictions.

To predict the facies of the seismic area, deep learning has recently been applied. However, when applying machine learning (ML) to the facies classification, there is a problem that the data available for training are very limited. When using training data acquired under such limited conditions, such as well log data, there can be a severe imbalance in the number of training samples for the facies because the amount of data acquired in the hydrocarbon area of interest is relatively less than that acquired in the nonhydrocarbon area. Thus, the facies classification results often show weighted predictions of a specific facies due to the imbalance issue of training data.In this study, to solve the limitation and the imbalance problems of training data, the data augmentation technique based on CycleGAN (Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks) was conducted. Using CycleGAN, the training data for the class with less data can be augmented using the class with more data. By comparing the results of the facies classification with and without the augmentation of the training data using Cycle GAN, we have demonstrated that the more accurate classification model is trained when the CycleGAN is applied. Therefore, the data augmentation scheme developed in this study will be very useful for the facies classification in an environment where training data is very limited.To obtain a permit for any seismic survey it is often necessary to demonstrate the potential impact of seismic sources on any marine mammals present in the survey area. This is called environmental modeling, and is done by estimating the sound levels emitted from the source as well as the corresponding received levels; the latter being what any marine animal present in the area would hear. I consider two different survey areas and the challenges associated with them. A different approach was used for each of them in order to assess the impact on marine fauna in the respective survey areas. © 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,"Society of Exploration Geophysicists"

For effective diagnosis of RCTs, orthopedic surgeons typically need to have access to both shoulder Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and proton density-weighted imaging. However, the generation and interpretation of such comprehensive image information is labor intensive, and thus time consuming and costly. Although computer-aided diagnosis can help in mitigating the aforementioned issues, no computational tools are currently available for diagnosing RCTs. Therefore, we introduce a computational approach towards RCT diagnosis in this paper, leveraging end-to-end learning by applying a deep convolutional neural network to shoulder MRI scans. Given that these shoulder MRI scans are 3-D by nature and highly biased towards normal shoulders, with only 6.6% of the available shoulder MRI scans containing partial-thickness tears, we made use of two tools to enhance our deep convolutional neural network. First, to enable the utilization of sequential information available in the 3-D MRI scans, we integrated a weighted linear combination layer. Second, to mitigate the presence of class imbalance, we adopted weighted cross-entropy loss. That way, we were able to obtain a diagnostic accuracy of 87% and an M-AUC score of 97%, outperforming a baseline of human annotators (diagnostic accuracy of 76% and an M-AUC score of 81%). In addition, we were able to outperform several approaches using conventional machine learning techniques. Finally, to facilitate further research efforts and ease of benchmarking, we make our dataset of 2, 447 shoulder MRI scans publicly available. © 2020 M. Kim, H.-m. Park, J.Y.K.M. Ph.D., S.H.K.M.

In the past decades, kinds of techniques have been proposed to alleviate this problem. Among those approaches, one promising method, interpolation-based oversampling, proposes to generate synthetic minority samples based on selected reference data, which can effectively solve the skewed distribution of data samples. However, there are several unsolved issues in interpolation-based oversampling. Existing methods often suffer from noisy synthetic samples due to improper data clustering and unsatisfactory reference selection. In this paper, we propose the position-aware safe boundary interpolation oversampling algorithm (PABIO) to address such issues. We firstly introduce a combined clustering algorithm for minority samples to overcome the shortage of clustering methods which are only distance-based or density-based. Then a position-aware interpolation-based oversampling algorithm is proposed for different minority clusters. Especially, we develop a novel method to leverage the majority class information to learn a safe boundary for generating synthetic points. The proposed PABIO is evaluated on multiple imbalanced datasets classified by two base classifiers: support vector machine (SVM) and C4.5 decision tree classifier.

In this way, one of the biggest threats faces by commercial banks is the risk prediction of credit clients. Recent studies mostly focus on enhancing the classifier performance for credit card default prediction rather than an interpretable model. In classification problems, an imbalanced dataset is also crucial to improve the performance of the model because most of the cases lied in one class, and only a few examples are in other categories. Traditional statistical approaches are not suitable to deal with imbalanced data. In this study, a model is developed for credit default prediction by employing various credit-related datasets. There is often a significant difference between the minimum and maximum values in different features, so Min-Max normalization is used to scale the features within one range. Data level resampling techniques are employed to overcome the problem of the data imbalance. Various undersampling and oversampling methods are used to resolve the issue of class imbalance. Different machine learning models are also employed to obtain efficient results. We developed the hypothesis of whether developed models using different machine learning techniques are significantly the same or different and whether resampling techniques significantly improves the performance of the proposed models. One-way Analysis of Variance is a hypothesis-testing technique, used to test the significance of the results. The split method is utilized to validate the results in which data has split into training and test sets. The results on imbalanced datasets show the accuracy of 66.9% on Taiwan clients credit dataset, 70.7% on South German clients credit dataset, and 65% on Belgium clients credit dataset. Conversely, the results using our proposed methods significantly improve the accuracy of 89% on Taiwan clients credit dataset, 84.6% on South German clients credit dataset, and 87.1% on Belgium clients credit dataset. The results show that the performance of classifiers is better on the balanced dataset as compared to the imbalanced dataset. It is also observed that the performance of data oversampling techniques are better than undersampling techniques. Overall, the Gradient Boosted Decision Tree method performs better than other traditional machine learning classifiers. The Gradient Boosted Decision Tree method gives the best results while utilizing the K-means SMOTE oversampling method. Using one-way ANOVA, the null hypothesis was rejected by a p-value <0.001, hence confirming that the proposed model improved performance is statistical significance.

However, the current need to manually classify individual images introduces a bottleneck into processing chains. Although Machine Learning techniques have been used to try and address this issue, past efforts have suffered from accuracy limitations, especially in minority classes. Here we use state-of-the-art methods in Deep Learning to investigate suitable architectures for training an automated plankton classification system which achieves high efficacy for both abundant and rare taxa. We collected live plankton from Station L4 in the Western English Channel and imaged 11,371 particles covering 104 taxonomic groups using the automated plankton imaging system FlowCam. The image set contained a severe class imbalance, with some taxa represented by > 600 images while other, rarer taxa were represented by just 14. We demonstrate that by allowing multiple Deep Learning models to collaborate in a single classification system, classification accuracy improves for minority classes when compared with the best individual model. The top collaborative model achieved a 6 % improvement in F1 accuracy over the best individual model, while overall accuracy improved by 3.2 %. This resulted in a 97.4 % overall accuracy score and a 96.2 % F1 macro score on a separate holdout test set containing 104 taxonomic groups. Based on a survey of similar studies in the literature, we believe collaborative deep learning models can significantly improve the accuracy of existing automated plankton classification systems. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

To launch the successful attack on a particular public key cryptographic (PKC) algorithm, a large number of samples per trace might need to be acquired to capture all the minor useful details from the leakage information, which increases the number of features per instance. The decreased instance-feature ratio increases the computational complexity of the deep learning-based attacks, limiting the attack efficiency. Moreover, data class imbalance can be a hindrance in accurate model training, leading to an accuracy paradox. We propose an efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based approach in which the dimensionality of the large leakage dataset is reduced, and then the data is processed using the proposed CNN based model. In the proposed model, the optimal number of convolutional blocks is used to build powerful features extractors within the cost limit. We have also analyzed and presented the impact of using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) on the proposed model performance. We propose that a data-balancing step should be mandatory for analysis in the side channel attack scenario. We have also provided a performance-based comparative analysis between proposed and existing deep learning models for unprotected and protected Elliptic curve (ECC) Montgomery Power ladder implementations.

To tackle these issues, we propose a novel Deep Learning approach via adaptive cross-dataset scheme. We combine multiple in-the-wild datasets to secure sufficient training samples while minimizing dataset bias using ideas of reversal gradients to retain generality. For this, we introduce a flexible objective function that can control for skewed label distributions in the dataset. Incorporating these ideas, together with the ResNet pipeline as a backbone, we carried extensive experiments to validate our ideas using three independent in-the-wild facial expression datasets, which first confirmed bias from different datasets and yielded improved performance on facial expression recognition using the multi-site dataset. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

To tackle the challenge, we first use feature engineering to design effective features, by taking the difference between each service provider and its group cohort into consideration.

Though retention campaigns may be used to prevent customer churn, their success depends on the availability of accurate prediction models. Churn prediction is notoriously a difficult problem because of the large amount of data, non-linearity, imbalance and low separability between the classes of churners and non-churners. In this paper, we discuss a real case of churn prediction based on Orange Belgium customer data. In the first part of the paper we focus on the design of an accurate prediction model. The large class imbalance between the two classes is handled with the EasyEnsemble algorithm using a random forest classifier. We assess also the impact of different data preprocessing techniques including feature selection and engineering. Results show that feature selection can be used to reduce computation time and memory requirements, though engineering variables does not necessarily improve performance. In the second part of the paper we explore the application of data-driven causal inference, which aims to infer causal relationships between variables from observational data. We conclude that the bill shock and the wrong tariff plan positioning are putative causes of churn. This is supported by the prior knowledge of experts at Orange Belgium. Finally, we present a novel method to evaluate, in terms of the direction and magnitude, the impact of causally relevant variables on churn, making the assumption of no confounding factors. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data; Causal inference; Churn prediction; Machine learning","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

Most smokers make multiple quit attempts during their lifetime but smoking dependence is not easy and many people eventually failed quit attempts. Predicting the likelihood of success in smoking cessation program is necessary for public health. In recent years, a few numbers of decision support systems have been developed for dealing with smoking cessation based on machine learning techniques. However, the class imbalance problem is increasingly recognized as serious in real-world applications. Therefore, this paper presents a synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) based decision support framework in order to predict the success of smoking cessation program using Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) dataset. We carried out experiments as follows: I) the unnecessary instances and variables have been eliminated, II) then we employed three variations of SMOTE, III) also the prediction models have been constructed. Finally, compare the prediction models to obtain the best model. Our experimental results showed that SMOTE improved the prediction performance of machine learning classifiers among evaluation metrics. Moreover, SMOTE regular based Random Forest (RF) and Naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers were determined the best prediction models in real-world smoking cessation dataset. Consequently, our decision support framework can interpret the important risk factors of smoking cessation using multivariate regression analysis. Copyright: The Author(s).

We address these challenges by using a controlled variant of Mixup data augmentation, a method for generating additional data samples by linearly combining different pairs of data samples and their corresponding class labels.

We demonstrate that our proposed strategy is able to detect over 99% of poisoned examples in both attacks and remove them without compromising model performance.

Classification lies at the core of Machine Learning and Multi-label Classification (MLC) is the closest to real-life problems related to heuristics. It is a type of classification problem where multiple labels or classes can be assigned to more than one instance simultaneously. The level of complexity in MLC is increased by factors such as data imbalance, high dimensionality, label correlations, and noise. Conventional MLC techniques such as ensembles-based approaches, Multi-label Stacking, Random k-label sets, and Hierarchy of Multi-label Classifiers struggle to handle these issues and suffer from the increased complexity introduced by these factors. The application of Soft Computing (SC) techniques in intelligent systems has provided a new paradigm for complex real-life problems. These techniques are more tolerant of the inherent imprecision and ambiguity in human thinking. Based on SC techniques such as evolutionary computing and genetic algorithms, intelligent classification systems can be developed that can recognize complex patterns even in noisy datasets otherwise invisible to conventional sys-tems. This study uses an evolutionary approach to handle the MLC noise issue by proposing the Evolutionary Ensemble of Credal C4.5 (EECC). It uses the Credal C4.5 classifier which is based on imprecise probability theory for handling noisy datasets. It can perform effectively in diverse areas of multi-label classification. Experiments on different datasets show that EECC outperforms other techniques in the presence of noise and is noise-robust. Statistical tests show the significance of EECC as compared to other techniques. © 2020, Tech Science Press.

The proposed method employs the discriminative characteristics used in feature maps and generative adversarial networks (GANs), to minimize the deviation that occurs when a common feature is shifted between two domains. To solve class imbalance problem and increase the model’s detection accuracy, new data samples are generated by applying a minority class data augmentation method, which uses a GAN. We evaluate the classification performance of the proposed domain-adaption model by comparing it against support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) models, using classification performance evaluation indicators. The experimental results indicated that the proposed model is applicable to both test datasets; furthermore, it requires less time for learning. Although the SVM offers a better detection performance than the CNN and proposed domain-adaptation model, its learning time exceeds those of the other two models when dataset increases. Also, although the detection performance of the CNN-based model is similar to that of the proposed domain-adaptation model, its learning process is longer. In addition, although the GAN used to solve the class imbalance problem of the two datasets requires slightly more time than SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique), it shows a better classification performance and is effective for datasets featuring class imbalances. © 2020.

Consequently, web applications have increasingly become the target of cyberattacks. Notably, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on web applications are increasing and have become the critical focus of information security experts' reports. Machine learning (ML) technique has significantly advanced and shown impressive results in the area of cybersecurity. However, XSS training datasets are often limited and significantly unbalanced, which does not meet well-developed ML algorithms' requirements and potentially limits the detection system efficiency. Furthermore, XSS attacks have multiple payload vectors that execute in different ways, resulting in many real threats passing through the detection system undetected. In this study, we propose a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a gradient penalty to enhance the XSS detection system in a low-resource data environment. The proposed method integrates a conditional generative adversarial network and Wasserstein generative adversarial network with a gradient penalty to obtain necessary data from directivity, which improves the strength of the security system over unbalance data. The proposed method generates synthetic samples of minority class that have identical distribution as real XSS attack scenarios. The augmented data were used to train a new boosting model and subsequently evaluated the model using a real test dataset. Experiments on two unbalanced XSS attack datasets demonstrate that the proposed model generates valid and reliable samples. Furthermore, the samples were indistinguishable from real XSS data and significantly enhanced the detection of XSS attacks compared with state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Mokbal et al.","Conditional-Wasserstein generative adversarial net; Data augmentation; Imbalance dataset; XSS Attack","PeerJ Inc."

Given the cost in acquiring large-sized training datasets, it is useful to examine if QSAR analysis can reasonably predict drug activity with only a small-sized dataset (size &#x003C; 100) and benchmark these small-dataset QSAR models in application-specific studies. To this end, here we present a systematic benchmarking study on small-dataset QSAR models built for prediction of effective Wnt signaling inhibitors, which are essential to therapeutics development in prevalent human diseases (e.g., cancer). Specifically, we examined a total of 72 two-dimensional (2D) QSAR models based on 4 best-performing algorithms, 6 commonly used molecular fingerprints, and 3 typical fingerprint lengths. We trained these models using a training dataset (56 compounds), benchmarked their performance on 4 figures-of-merit (FOMs), and examined their prediction accuracy using an external validation dataset (14 compounds). Our data show that the model performance is maximized when: 1) molecular fingerprints are selected to provide sufficient, unique, and not overly detailed representations of the chemical structures of drug compounds; 2) algorithms are selected to reduce the number of false predictions due to class imbalance in the dataset; and 3) models are selected to reach balanced performance on all 4 FOMs. These results may provide general guidelines in developing high-performance small-dataset QSAR models for drug activity prediction.

In this work, we propose a novel deep learning-based sentiment analysis technique to check whether there are anomalous activities in OS logs. Log messages are modeled as sentences and we identify the sentiments using the gated recurrent unit (GRU) networks. OS log datasets inherently have a class imbalance in the sense that the number of negative sentiment is much lower than that of the number of positive ones.

It is notably difficult to develop an effective model using traditional data mining and machine learning algorithms without using data preprocessing techniques to balance the dataset. Oversampling is often used as a pretreatment method for imbalanced datasets. Specifically, synthetic oversampling techniques focus on balancing the number of training instances between the majority class and the minority class by generating extra artificial minority class instances. However, the current oversampling techniques simply consider the imbalance of quantity and pay no attention to whether the distribution is balanced or not. Therefore, this paper proposes an entropy difference and kernel-based SMOTE (EDKS) which considers the imbalance degree of dataset from distribution by entropy difference and overcomes the limitation of SMOTE for nonlinear problems by oversampling in the feature space of support vector machine classifier. First, the EDKS method maps the input data into a feature space to increase the separability of the data. Then EDKS calculates the entropy difference in kernel space, determines the majority class and minority class, and finds the sparse regions in the minority class. Moreover, the proposed method balances the data distribution by synthesizing new instances and evaluating its retention capability. Our algorithm can effectively distinguish those datasets with the same imbalance ratio but different distribution. The experimental study evaluates and compares the performance of our method against state-of-the-art algorithms, and then demonstrates that the proposed approach is competitive with the state-of-art algorithms on multiple benchmark imbalanced datasets. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Graph based semi-supervised algorithms make an assumption of similarity of examples in lower dimensional manifold and use an objective that ensures similarity of labels as enforced by the similarity graph. Such methods typically make use of a L2 regularization term to avoid over-fitting. Regularization term further ensures convexity of the overall objective leading to efficient learning algorithms. Addressing the problem of low-supervision and high class imbalance, prior work has shown state-of-the-art results for anomaly detection and other important classification problems by using a convex-concave objective. The current work analyses such performance improvements of convex-concave objective thoroughly.

Even in the likelihood of having access to sufficient data, the process of accurately labeling the data is an arduous and time-consuming one, requiring expertise skills. Again, the issue of unbalanced data further compounds the abovementioned problems and presents a considerable challenge for many machine learning algorithms. In lieu of this, the ability to develop algorithms that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled data together with a small amount of labeled data, while demonstrating robustness to data imbalance, can offer promising prospects in building highly efficient classifiers. This work proposes a semisupervised learning method that integrates self-training and self-paced learning to generate and select pseudolabeled samples for classifying breast cancer histopathological images. A novel pseudolabel generation and selection algorithm is introduced in the learning scheme to generate and select highly confident pseudolabeled samples from both well-represented classes to less-represented classes. Such a learning approach improves the performance by jointly learning a model and optimizing the generation of pseudolabels on unlabeled-target data to augment the training data and retraining the model with the generated labels. A class balancing framework that normalizes the class-wise confidence scores is also proposed to prevent the model from ignoring samples from less represented classes (hard-to-learn samples), hence effectively handling the issue of data imbalance.

We propose a differentiable approximation to the F-measure and train the network with this objective using standard backpropagation. We perform experiments on two standard fairness datasets, Adult, and Communities and Crime, and also on speech-to-intent detection on the ATIS dataset and speech-to-image concept classification on the Speech-COCO dataset. In all four of these tasks, F-measure maximization results in improved micro-F1 scores, with absolute improvements of up to 8% absolute, as compared to models trained with the cross-entropy loss function.

An anomaly-based intrusion detection system detects abnormal patterns based on deviations from expected normal behaviors; however, such a system has a low detection rate. Also a detection accuracy may vary depending on whether abnormal samples are used during learning. Moreover, it may vary according to the degree of class imbalance that means the imbalance of data class distributions. To avoid the problem and to enhance the low predictive accuracy, it might need to augment minority datasets through the creation of new samples. Therefore, recently, some of existing studies have involved the development of intrusion detection models using machine/deep learning algorithms to overcome the limitations of existing anomaly-based intrusion detection methodologies and to avoid class imbalance problems. In a similar vein, this study proposes a method for improving classification performance of normal and abnormal data in anomaly-based intrusion detection systems by applying data augmentation using GAN. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed anomaly detection method, we use the ADFA-LD Dataset which consists of system call traces for attacks on the latest operating systems. Experiments were performed using SVM (Support Vector Machine) and CNN (Convolution Neural Network) for classification, and GAN and SMOTE for data augmentation, respectively. The experimental results indicated that GAN based approach provides a slightly more reliable way of working with data augmentation than SMOTE. In addition, it was confirmed based on the experimental results that the classification performance can be improved as the number of samples belonging to each imbalanced class increases. © International Research Publication House.","Anomaly detection; Cyber security; GAN; Host based intrusion detection system; Machine / deep learning; System calls","International Research Publication House"

Learning algorithms in an imbalanced dataset can yield an overrated classification accuracy driven by a bias towards the majority class at the expense of the minority class. On the other hand, missing values in data can induce complexity in the learning classifiers during data analysis. These two problems pose substantial challenges to the performance of learning algorithms in real-life water quality anomaly detection problems. Hence, the need for them to be carefully considered and addressed to achieve better performance. In this paper, the performance of a range of several combinations of techniques to deal with imbalanced classes in the context of binary-imbalanced water quality anomaly detection problem and the presence of missing values is extensively compare. The methods considered include seven missing data and eight resampling methods, on ten different learning state-of-the-art classifiers taking into account diversity in their learning philosophies. The different classifiers are evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation, based on three performance evaluation metrics namely accuracy, ROC-AUC and F1-measure. Further experiments are carried out on nineteen variants of homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble techniques embedded with resampling and missing value strategies during their training phase as well as an optimized deep neural network model. The experimental results show an improvement in the performance of the learning classifiers, especially when dealing with the class imbalance problem (on the one hand) and the incomplete data problem (on the other hand).

We specifically address two requirements that arise when training machine learning models for AML: scalability and imbalance-resistance. By scalability we mean the ability to train the models to very large transaction datasets. By imbalance-resistance we mean the ability for the model to achieve suitable accuracy despite high class imbalance, i.e. the low number of instances of potentially illicit behavior relative to a large number of features that may characterize potentially illicit behavior. We propose a two-layered modelling concept. The first layer consists of a Logistic Regression model with simple features, which can be computed with low overhead. These features capture customer profiles as well as global aggregates of transaction histories. This layer filters out a proportion of customers whose activity patterns can be deemed non-illicit with high confidence. In the second layer, a gradient boosting model with complex features is used so as to classify the remaining customers. We anticipate that this two-layered approach achieves the stated requirements. Firstly, feature extraction is more scalable as the more computationally demanding features of the second layer do not need to be extracted for every customer. Secondly, the first layer acts as an undersampling method for the second layer, thus partially addressing the class imbalance. We validate the approach using a real dataset of customer profiles and transaction histories, together with labels provided by AML experts. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Anti-money laundering; Machine learning","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

A classification algorithm trained with unbalanced data is likely to be biased towards the majority class and thus show inferior performance on the minority class. To improve the performance of deep neural network (DNN) models on poorly balanced data, we hybridized two well-performing loss functions, specially designed for learning imbalanced data, mean false error and focal loss. Since mean false error can effectively balance between majority and minority classes and focal loss can reduce the contribution of unnecessary samples, which are usually samples from the majority class, which may cause a DNN model to be biased towards the majority class when learning. We show that hybridizing the two losses can improve the classification performance of the model. Our hybrid loss function was tested with unbalanced data sets, extracted from CIFAR-100 and IMDB review datasets, and showed that, overall, it performed better than mean false error or focal loss. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Class imbalance; Deep neural network; Loss function","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

Machine learning techniques have demonstrated great potential in aiding disease diagnosis. In this paper, we present a framework to predict the onset of AMI using 713,447 extracted ECG samples and associated auxiliary data from the longitudinal and comprehensive ECG-ViEW II database, previously unexplored in the field of machine learning in healthcare. The framework is realized with two deep learning models, a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a decision-tree based model, XGBoost. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) was utilized to address class imbalance. High prediction accuracy of 89.9%, 84.6%, 97.5% and ROC curve areas of 90.7%, 82.9%, 96.5% have been achieved for the best CNN, RNN, and XGBoost models, respectively. Shapley values were utilized to identify the features that contributed most to the classification decision with XGBoost, demonstrating the high impact of auxiliary inputs such as age and sex. This paper demonstrates the promising application of explainable machine learning in the field of cardiovascular disease prediction.

One of the key characteristics of Bitcoin is anonymity, which makes the Bitcoin market unregulated and a large number of criminal and illicit activities are associated with bitcoin transactions. Therefore, it’s necessary to identify the illicit addresses in the Bitcoin network for safeguarding financial systems and protecting user’s assets. To identify the illicit addresses in the Bitcoin network, first, we collect a large dataset of illicit addresses. The illicit addresses come mainly from some specific websites, public forums, and research papers. Second, we make a careful design of the features of illicit addresses. The features include basic features that refer to the related papers and the novel proposed features (topological features and temporal features). Third, we apply various machine learning algorithms (RF, SVM, XGB, ANN) to evaluate our features, which indicates that the proposed features are discriminating and robust. Besides, the paper discusses the class imbalance problem and achieves a better enhancement when using the cost-sensitive approach. Moreover, the paper proposes a model that incorporates LSTM into auto-encoder to generate temporal features. Results show that the generated features are helpful for the illicit addresses identification.

Innumerable sources stress the importance of learning from these mistakes. However, within the construction industry, there is heavy reliance on learning from case-studies of catastrophic events and a lack of attention to the more frequent, lower consequence and yet repetitive failures. These smaller failures can have huge cumulative impact, not to mention their effects on the individual(s) involved. The Health and Safety Executive in their 2018 Annual Report estimated that safety injuries on site cost £490M to the UK economy. Part of this historic inattention is due to difficulties in analysis and sense-making of these failures. While information is collected about the failure event, the data tends to be in the form of free text, which is notoriously difficult to analyse. To begin addressing this, we present an attribute-based method which uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to structure text data collected after a safety failure on-site, including near misses and incidents. This structured data allows systematic analysis of these data to improve construction site practices and facilitate data driven decision-making that will reduce safety incidents. Using descriptions from 2345 safety reports, provided by a UK based construction company, we manually refine a set of attribute-based event descriptors from the text descriptions of the incidents and train an NLP model to automatically predict these in new descriptions. As well as presenting a working example of this method, factors affecting the prediction accuracy were also explored. This critique found four aspects which need deliberate consideration in application of NLP to construction safety text. These are (1) the number of attributes; (2) data class imbalance; (3) inclusion of near-miss data as well as incident reports; and (4) algorithm selection and optimisation. This method also anonymises the reports, allowing potential industry-wide data sharing and learning. © 2020 Association of Researchers in Construction Management.","AI; Machine learning; Natural language processing (NLP); Safety","Association of Researchers in Construction Management"

Along with the ability to process large amounts of data, machine learning brings the potential to detect contextual and collective anomalies, an essential attribute of an ideal threat detection system. Datasets play a vital role in developing machine learning models that are capable of detecting complex and sophisticated threats like Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). However, there is currently no APT-dataset that can be used for modeling and detecting APT attacks. Characterized by the sophistication involved and the determined nature of the APT attackers, these threats are not only difficult to detect but also to model. Generic intrusion datasets have three key limitations - (1) They capture attack traffic at the external endpoints, limiting their usefulness in the context of APTs which comprise of attack vectors within the internal network as well (2) The difference between normal and anomalous behavior is quiet distinguishable in these datasets and thus fails to represent the sophisticated attackers’ of APT attacks (3) The data imbalance in existing datasets do not reflect the real-world settings rendering themselves as a benchmark for supervised models and falling short of semi-supervised learning. To address these concerns, in this paper, we propose a dataset DAPT 2020 which consists of attacks that are part of Advanced Persistent Threats (APT). These attacks (1) are hard to distinguish from normal traffic flows but investigate the raw feature space and (2) comprise of traffic on both public-to-private interface and the internal (private) network. Due to the existence of severe class imbalance, we benchmark DAPT 2020 dataset on semi-supervised models and show that they perform poorly trying to detect attack traffic in the various stages of an APT. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Advanced Persistent Threat; Anomaly detection; Benchmark dataset; Long Term Short Memory (LSTM); Stacked Autoencoder (SAE)","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

Various studies have been conducted for a long time to solve this problem, and many solutions have recently been developed to perform real-time health monitoring by attaching sensors to facilities. In addition, machine learning has allowed more accurate diagnosis of the condition to be carried out on these collected data. However, real-time fault detection is accompanied by a number of difficulties. Class imbalance issues are considered one of the most representative factors that makes it difficult to apply machine learning models in real-world locations. Class imbalance means that when it comes to classification problems, the amount of data in one class is greater than that in another class. In this case, the machine learning model is overfitted to a class with a lot of data, causing performance degradation. In real-world sites, the performance degradation of the model due to class imbalance is very serious because most data occurs in normal state, while fault data does not occur very well. Several prior studies have proposed ways to overcome this class imbalance, but each has several limitations. In this paper, an algorithm solution method and computing architecture solution method are introduced together as methodologies to overcome class imbalance, and a robust classification model is designed for class imbalance. © 2020 The Authors.","Binary classification; Class imbalance; Ensemble; Fault detection; Fog computing","Elsevier B.V."

Closed-circuit television (CCTV) inspection technology is the most common method to identify aging sewer pipes requiring rehabilitation. While these inspections provide essential information on the condition of pipes, assessing all pipes in the network is expensive, and often limited to small portions of an entire sewer system. Therefore, it would be more beneficial to use predictive analytics to leverage existing inspection datasets and then forecast the condition of pipes that have not yet been inspected. The predictive capabilities of machine learning model, namely gradient boosting tree is demonstrated based on data provided by inspection reports from City of Tampa. Three main factors, physical, operational, and environmental were considered during the selection of variables in development of this model. Thirteen independent variables including pipe's age, material, diameter, flow rate, pipe segment length, depth, slope, soil type, pH, sulfate content, water table, soil hydraulic group, and soil corrosivity were used to build the prediction model. Complications posed by imbalance between condition classes are overcome by changing the classification classes into a binary format (where pipes are in either good or critical structural condition) and then the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and confusion matrix were used to measure the performance of the model. The developed model showed 87% accuracy to predict condition of un-inspected sewer pipes. The results can be used by utility companies and municipalities to forecast condition of sanitary sewer pipes, schedule inspection times, and make cost-effective decisions to match budget allocations. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)"

A severe problem of such settings consists in the fact that the underlying data distribution might change over time and concept drift or change of the feature characteristics have to be dealt with. In addition, data are often imbalanced because training signals for rare classes are particularly sparse. In the last years, a number of learning technologies have been proposed, which can reliably learn in the presence of drift, whereby non-parametric approaches such as the recent model SAM-kNN[10] can deal particularly well with heterogeneous or priorly unknown types of drift. Yet these methods share the deficiencies of the underlying vanilla-kNN classifier when dealing with imbalanced classes.

EEG, which is a kind of complicated signal, can be used for epileptic seizure detection and epilepsy diagnosis via machine learning. A large amount of effort, including raw signal preprocessing and data preprocessing for machine learning, is required for constructing high-quality training datasets because the classification performance highly depends on high-quality data. Feature extraction has been widely used in EEG-based early epileptic seizure detection. Due to the complexity of data collection and labeling, some of the training instances are inevitably mislabeled. That means some similar instances have different labels. This is called the issue of class overlap, which leads to a poor class boundary for classification models and makes constructing a high-quality classification model more difficult. However, the previous studies investigating the impact of the class overlap for EEG data is quite limited. Our goal is to investigate the impact of the class overlap on EEG-based early epileptic seizure detection. We propose a special neighborhood cleaning rule (SNCR) to solve the class overlap issue. To alleviate the class overlap issue, we conduct large-scale experiments on two widely-used EEG datasets and compare our proposed SNCR strategy with a state-of-the-art data clean strategy, i.e., the improved k-means clustering cleaning approach (IKMCCA). The experimental results show that the classification model can achieve significantly better performance in terms of AUC, recall, and F1 metrics when using our proposed SNCR strategy. Therefore, for EEG-based early epileptic seizure detection, we recommend researchers to apply the SNCR strategy to mitigate the class overlap issue and use the SNCR strategy to perform data preprocessing in a future related study. © 2013 IEEE.","class imbalance; class overlap; early epileptic seizure detection; EEG; empirical evaluation","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

In big data analytics, the issue of handling class imbalance has been understudied and this is mainly attributed to the problems of small disjuncts of an imbalanced dataset. This study proposes a stacked ensemble model based on RUSBoost and cost sensitive convolution neural network for tackling class imbalance issues in big data analytics, The RUSBoost algorithm handles the class imbalance at the data level by intelligently and randomly removing samples from the majority class while the cost-sensitive convolutional neural network handles the imbalance at the algorithm level by enabling the convolutional algorithm automatically learn the cost during the training period. The ImageNet and WHOI-Plankton datasets were used to evaluate the proposed model as they met the imbalance ration standard set of 100:1 in addition to containing more than 100,000 records. The results posted showed the proposed stacked ensemble model outperformed existing ensemble techniques such as the SMOTEBoost and AdaBoost which were seen to immensely improve on the classification performance given an imbalanced dataset. The recall, precision and gmean value posted by the proposed algorithm were 80.2%, 95% and 87.3%respectively. Therefore the proposed model is seen as a better, faster and less complex alternative for handling class imbalance in big dataset. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

A method called resampling, which adjusts the number of majority and minority instances, is usually used to solve the imbalance in training data. Although resampling can eliminate imbalances, it may cause data complexity that deteriorates classification accuracy. Noise and overlap are well-known factors of data complexity. Noise is mixture of instances with features that can be classified into other classes at the time of training, and overlap represents the state in which classes cannot be linearly separated because they partially overlap each other. However, conventional methods could not consider these factors at a time, so that their classification accuracy would be not praiseworthy. In order to deal with both noise and overlap, we just need to integrate each of the methods that can deal with them. We know that there have already been established the methods to deal with each problem; however a simple integration of them may remove instances from the dataset that do not need to be removed, or may leave ones that should be removed. Therefore, we have to quantify these factors to take into account for data complexity, and have to consider more effective ways of their integration. In this paper, we propose a method for integrating well-known two resampling methods, which are called SMOTE-ENN and SMOTE-Tomek. In four out of ten datasets, our experimental result showed that our method is effective compared with the latest conventional methods. © 2020 The Authors.

Studies have indicated that the early treatment, especially during early brain development in the first two years of life, can significantly improve the symptoms, therefore, it is important to identify ASD as early as possible. Most previous works employed imaging-based biomarkers for the early diagnosis of ASD. However, they only focused on extracting features from the intensity images, ignoring the more informative guidance from segmentation and parcellation maps. Moreover, since the number of autistic subjects is always much smaller than that of normal subjects, this class-imbalance issue makes the ASD diagnosis more challenging. In this work, we propose an end-to-end informative feature-guided Siamese network for the early ASD diagnosis. Specifically, besides T1w and T2w images, the discriminative features from segmentation and parcellation maps are also employed to train the model. To alleviate the class-imbalance issue, the Siamese network is utilized to effectively learn what makes the pair of inputs belong to the same class or different classes. Furthermore, the subject-specific attention module is incorporated to identify the ASD-related regions in an end-to-end fully automatic learning manner. Both ablation study and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an overall accuracy of 85.4%, sensitivity of 80.8%, and specificity of 86.7%. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Autism spectrum disorder; Early diagnosis; Siamese network; Subject-specific attention","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

Using this complementary relationship to do oversampling to change the imbalanced state is a valuable method. However, the data island limits data sharing in this case between the nodes. To this end, we propose DOS-GAN, which can take turns to use the data of one same class data on multiple nodes to train the global GAN model, and then use this GAN generator to oversampling the class without the original data being exchanged.

X-Ray computed tomography (CT) can produce high-quality images of the parts in a non-destructive manner. The images, however, are grayscale valued, often have artifacts and noise, and require expert interpretation to spot flaws. In order for anomaly detection to be reproducible and cost effective, an automated method is needed to find potential defects. Traditional supervised machine learning techniques fail in the high reliability parts regime due to large class imbalance: there are often many more examples of well-built parts than there are defective parts. This, coupled with the time expense of obtaining labeled data, motivates research into unsupervised techniques. In particular, we build upon the AnoGAN and f-AnoGAN work by T. Schlegl et al. and created a new architecture called PandaNet. PandaNet learns an encoding function to a latent space of defect-free components and a decoding function to reconstruct the original image. We restrict the training data to defect-free components so that the encode-decode operation cannot learn to reproduce defects well. The difference between the reconstruction and the original image highlights anomalies that can be used for defect detection. In our work with CT images, PandaNet successfully identifies cracks, voids, and high z inclusions. Beyond CT, we demonstrate PandaNet working successfully with little to no modifications on a variety of common 2-D defect datasets both in color and grayscale. © 2020 COPYRIGHT SPIE.","Anomaly detection; Deep learning; Machine learning; Outlier detection; Quality assurance","SPIE"

However, the effectiveness of the predictive models depends on the quality of data sets used to train the model. In practice, the imbalanced datasets are quite common. For example, in the problems of lithotypes classification via whole core photos, some lithotypes often predominate the training dataset while some of the other lithotypes can be underrepresented. The significant imbalance in the dataset can affect the quality of the classification. In this case it is difficult to obtain good generalization for poorly represented classes. First, some characteristics of a given minor lithotype may be absent. Second, some features of a minor class can be ignored due to imbalance. In this paper, we analyze the oversampling of a minor class as one of the possible options to obtain the balanced dataset within the framework of the problem of speeding-up the geological core description. We considered examples with different dataset sizes and imbalance characteristics to study the effect of applying the oversampling approach on the quality of predictive models.

Hence, selection of an ideal number of dominant features from a comprehensive list of features is needed to decrease the number of computations involved in fault detection. In this paper, we attempted statistical time-domain features, namely, Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity) and normal negative log likelihood for Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for the first time in addition to 26 other established statistical features for identification of bearing fault type and severity. Two datasets are derived from a publicly available database of Case Western Reserve University to identify the capability of features in fault identification under various fault sizes and motor loads. Features have been investigated using a two-step approach - filter-based ranking with 3 metrics followed by feature subset selection with 11 search techniques. The results indicate that the set of features root mean square, geometric mean, zero crossing rate, Hjorth parameter - mobility, and normal negative log likelihood for GMM outperforms other features. We also compared the diagnostic performance of normal negative log likelihood for GMM with the established feature normal negative log likelihood for single Gaussian. The selected set of statistical features is validated using ensemble rule-based classifiers and showed an average accuracy of 96.75% with proposed statistical features subset and 99.63% with all 30 features. F-measure and G-mean scores are also calculated to investigate their performance on datasets with class imbalance. The diagnostic effectiveness of the features was further validated on a bearing dataset obtained from an operating thermal power plant. The results obtained show that our newly proposed feature subset plays a major role in achieving good classification results and has a future potential of being used in a high-dimensional dataset with multidomain features. © 2020 Chhaya Grover and Neelam Turk.",,"Hindawi Limited"

The proposed model initially used under sampling based on clustering method to reduce the effect of class-imbalance problem of the real datasets collected from National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD). The C5.0 decision tree was then utilized to select important risk factors, and an extreme learning machine using the selected factors as predictors was applied to construct an effective disease prediction model to predict the diabetic patients suffering from nephropathy and needing dialysis. Empirical results revealed that the proposed hybrid disease prediction scheme not only provides better classification accuracy than that of the three competing models in terms of classification accuracy but also exhibits the capability of identifying important risk factors that can provide useful information for identifying high-risk groups for the dialysis of diabetic nephropathy.

Most of the real-world data are imbalanced in nature. The traditional classifiers assume a well-balanced class distribution for training data but in practical datasets show up an imbalance, thus obscure a classifier and degrade its capability to learn from such imbalanced datasets. Data pre-processing approaches address this concern by using either random undersampling or oversampling techniques. In this paper, we introduce Earth mover's distance (EMD), as a similarity measure, to find the samples similar in nature and eliminate them as redundant from the dataset. Earth mover's distance has received a lot of attention in wide areas such as computer vision, image retrieval, machine learning, etc. The Earth mover's distance-based undersampling approach provides a solution at the data level to eliminate the redundant instances in majority samples without any loss of valuable information.

Class imbalances can be detected in many areas, including medical diagnostics, spam filtering, and fraud detection. Most machine learning algorithms work optimally when the number of samples in each class is approximately the same. This is because most algorithms are designed to maximize accuracy and reduce error. However, under conditions of class imbalance, the model may be overfitted, which leads to incorrect estimates of object classification. Thus, in order to avoid this phenomenon and achieve better results, it is necessary to research methods for working with unbalanced data, as well as develop effective algorithms for classifying them. In this paper, we study machine learning methods to eliminate class imbalance in data in order to improve accuracy in multi-class classification problems. In this paper, to improve the accuracy of classification, it is proposed to use a combination of classification algorithms and feature selection methods RFE, Random Forest and Boruta with pre-balancing classes by random sampling, SMOTE and ADASYN. Using data on skin diseases as an example, computer experiments have shown that the use of sampling algorithms to eliminate the imbalance of classes, as well as the selection of the most informative features, significantly improves the accuracy of classification results.

Currently, a trusted and secured banking payment system is crucial for both customers and banks. The problem from credit card fraud dataset is the data have many features and imbalanced class, this problem leads the paper to propose undersampling technique and feature reduction methods. In this paper we proposed two stage-feature reduction technique because a stage feature reduction could not find the optimal features. On the other hands, we are also applied Instance Hardness Threshold sampling and Random undersampling to deal with imbalance data. The two-stage feature reduction is chosen to eliminate the ineffective feature that cannot eliminate using only one feature reduction. The model from the implemented machine learning methods is evaluated using accuracy, specificity, recall, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. We implemented our proposed approaches in the ULB credit card fraud detection dataset.

For large-scale problems and dynamic data problem, incremental learning overwhelms batch learning, because of its efficient treatment for new data. However, class imbalance problem, which always appears in online classification brings a considerable challenge for incremental learning. The serious class imbalance problem may directly lead to a useless learning system. Cost-sensitive learning is an important learning paradigm for class imbalance problems and widely used in many applications. In this article, we propose an incremental cost-sensitive learning method to tackle the class imbalance problems in the online situation. This proposed algorithm is based on a novel cost-sensitive support vector machine, which uses the Linear-exponential (LINEX) loss to implement high cost for minority class and low cost for majority class. Using the half-quadratic optimization, we first put forward the algorithm for the cost-sensitive support vector machine, called CSLINEX-SVM∗. Then we propose the incremental cost-sensitive algorithm, ICSL-SVM. The results of numeric experiments demonstrate that the proposed incremental algorithm outperforms some conventional batch algorithms except the proposed CSLINEX-SVM∗. © 2013 IEEE.","class imbalance; cost-sensitive; incremental learning; LINEX loss; Online learning; support vector machine","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, typical credit card datasets present imbalanced classification situations because of severely skewed class distributions. Although researchers have proposed some strategies to deal with these imbalances, disadvantages remain. We propose an oversampling method based on variational automatic coding (VAE), combined with classic deep learning techniques, to solve this problem. The VAE method is used to generate a large amount of diverse cases from minority groups in an imbalanced dataset, which are then used to train the classification network. The proposed method is tested on an open credit card fraud dataset, which contains transactions conducted by European cardholders over two days in September 2013. Experimental results show that the VAE method performs better than synthetic minority oversampling techniques and traditional deep neural network methods. In addition, it outperforms recent oversampling methods based on generative adversarial network (GAN) models. After submitting the extended dataset to the baseline for training, the test of the VAE model performs well on indicators including precision, F-measure, accuracy and specificity. These experimental results suggest that the VAE-based oversampling method can be effectively applied to imbalanced classification problems. © 2013 IEEE.","Credit card fraud; deep learning; generative adversarial network; oversampling; variational automatic coding","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Some real world examples include medical image analysis, fraud detection, fault diagnosis, and anomaly detection. Although several data-level algorithms have been developed to address imbalance, they are typically subject to some restrictions. We propose a novel variant of the k-NN family of classifiers, and name this as Density-based Adaptive-distance kNN (DAkNN). It can effectively handle data with skewed distributions and varying class-densities using the concept of adaptive distance. Comparative superiority is experimentally established over related data-level algorithms (SMOTE, ADASYN), using ten sets of two-class data, in terms of geometric mean (of the true positive and negative rates) and accuracy. Additionally, five sets of multi-class data are considered and compared with different variants of k-NN, which are currently very popular. Finally, DAkNN is successfully applied on the highly imbalanced Lower Grade Glioma (LGG) MR images, with an Average-Dice score of 0.9082 for delineating the tumor regions.

In the absence of labeled data, domain adaptation often provides an attractive option given that labeled data of a similar nature but from a different domain is available. Previous work has chiefly focused on learning domain invariant representations but overlooked the issues of label imbalance in a single domain or across domains, which are common in many machine learning applications such as fake news detection. In this paper, we study a new cross-domain classification problem where data in each domain can be imbalanced (data imbalance), i.e., the classes are not evenly distributed, and the ratio of the number of positive over negative samples varies across domains (domain imbalance). This cross-domain problem is challenging as it entails covariate bias in the input feature space and representation bias in the latent space where domain invariant representations are learned. To address the challenge, in this paper, we propose an effective approach that leverages a doubly balancing strategy to simultaneously control these two types of bias and learn domain invariant representations. To this end, the proposed method aims to learn representations that are (i) robust to data and domain imbalance, (ii) discriminative between classes, and (iii) invariant across domains. Extensive evaluations of two important real-world applications corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

The existing works generally use dimension reduction methods to deal with the curse of dimensionality, then apply traditional imbalance learning techniques to combat the problem of class imbalance. However, dimensionality reduction may cause the loss of useful information, especially for the minority classes. This paper introduces an ensemble-based method, HIBoost, to directly handle the imbalanced learning problem in high dimensional space. HIBoost takes into account the inherent high-dimensional hubness phenomenon, i.e., high-dimensional data tends to contain the singular points (hubs and anti-hubs) which frequently or rarely occur in k-nearest neighbors of other points. For the singular hubs and anti-hubs induced by high dimension, HIBoost introduces a discount factor to restrict the weight growth of them in the process of updating weight, so that the risk of over fitting can be reduced when training component classifiers. For class imbalance problem, HIBoost uses SMOTE to balance the training data in each iteration so as to alleviate the prediction bias of component classifiers. Experimental results based on sixteen high-dimensional imbalanced data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of HIBoost. © 2020-IOS Press and the authors.

These predictions were disentangled by various methods of explainable AI (XAI) to understand whether the model showed any bias during prediction. Study 1 benchmarked these algorithms (knn, support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting machines, XGBoost) and identified random forests and XGBoost as best algorithms for predicting the product ratings. In Study 2, the analysis of global feature importance identified the sentiment joy and the emotional valence negative as most predictive features. Two XAI visualization methods, local feature attributions and partial dependency plots, revealed several incorrect prediction mechanisms on the instance-level. Performing the benchmarking as classification, Study 3 identified a high no-information rate of 64.4% that indicated high class imbalance as underlying reason for the identified problems. In conclusion, good performance by machine learning algorithms must be taken with caution because the dataset, as encountered in this work, could be biased towards certain predictions.

For evaluation, 10 fold cross-validation is performed. The efficiency of each classifier is assessed in terms of true positive, false positive, Roc curve, standard deviation (Std), and accuracy (AC).

This hinders the application of machine learning methods to exploit this data. Thus, this study explores the use of a recent model named CamemBERT to tackle these difficulties through transfer learning.

We pose the active sample selection as a constrained optimization problem and derive a linear programming relaxation to select a batch of samples. Contrary to existing algorithms, our framework is generic and is applicable to both binary and multi-class problems, where the imbalance may exist across multiple classes.

If the current trend continues, the overweight and obese population is likely to increase to 41% by 2030. Individuals developing signs of weight gain or obesity are also at a risk of developing serious illnesses such as type 2 diabetes, respiratory problems, heart disease and stroke. Some intervention measures such as physical activity and healthy eating can be a fundamental component to maintain a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, it is absolutely essential to detect childhood obesity as early as possible. This paper utilises the vast amount of data available via UK’s millennium cohort study in order to construct a machine learning driven model to predict young people at the risk of becoming overweight or obese. The childhood BMI values from the ages 3, 5, 7 and 11 are used to predict adolescents of age 14 at the risk of becoming overweight or obese. There is an inherent imbalance in the dataset of individuals with normal BMI and the ones at risk.

A conformational B-cell epitope is one of the main components of vaccine design. It contains separate segments in its sequence, which are spatially close in the antigen chain. The availability of Ag-Ab complex data on the Protein Data Bank allows for the development predictive methods. Several epitope prediction models also have been developed, including learning-based methods. However, the performance of the model is still not optimum. The main problem in learning-based prediction models is class imbalance. Methods. This study proposes CluSMOTE, which is a combination of a clusterbased undersampling method and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. The approach is used to generate other sample data to ensure that the dataset of the conformational epitope is balanced. The Hierarchical DBSCAN algorithm is performed to identify the cluster in the majority class. Some of the randomly selected data is taken from each cluster, considering the oversampling degree, and combined with the minority class data. The balance data is utilized as the training dataset to develop a conformational epitope prediction. Furthermore, two binary classification methods, Support Vector Machine and Decision Tree, are separately used to develop model prediction and to evaluate the performance of CluSMOTE in predicting conformational B-cell epitope. The experiment is focused on determining the best parameter for optimal CluSMOTE. Two independent datasets are used to compare the proposed prediction model with state of the art methods. The first and the second datasets represent the general protein and the glycoprotein antigens respectively. Result. The experimental result shows that CluSMOTE Decision Tree outperformed the Support Vector Machine in terms of AUC and Gmean as performance measurements. The mean AUC of CluSMOTE Decision Tree in the Kringelum and the SEPPA 3 test sets are 0.83 and 0.766, respectively. This shows that CluSMOTE Decision Tree is better than other methods in the general protein antigen, though comparable with SEPPA 3 in the glycoprotein antigen.

Cancer discrimination is a typical application of gene expression analysis using a microarray technique. However, microarray data suffer from the curse of dimensionality and usual imbalanced class distribution between the majority (tumor samples) and minority (normal samples) classes. Feature gene selection is necessary and important for cancer discrimination. Objectives: To select feature genes for the discrimination of CRC. Methods: We improve the feature selection algorithm based on differential evolution, DEFSw by using RUSBoost classifier and weight accuracy instead of the common classifier and evaluation measure for selecting feature genes from imbalance data. We firstly extract differently expressed genes (DEGs) from the CRC dataset of the TCGA and then select the feature genes from the DEGs using the improved DEFSw algorithm. Finally, we validate the selected feature gene sets using independent datasets and retrieve the cancer related information for these genes based on text mining through the Coremine Medical online database. Results: We select out 16 single-gene feature sets for colorectal cancer discrimination and 19 single-gene feature sets only for colon cancer discrimination. Conclusions: In summary, we find a series of high potential candidate biomarkers or signatures, which can discriminate either or both of colon cancer and rectal cancer with high sensitivity and specificity. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.","Colorectal cancer; Discrimination of cancer; Feature genes selection; Imbalanced data","Bentham Science Publishers"

With novel ML frameworks and big data repositories, our motive is to design a machine learning model to predict heart disease at the earliest, help prioritize hospital consultations and improve accuracy. For this study, several analyzes were carried out on the Cleveland heart disease data set with 303 patients records, using five different classifiers namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random forests, Ordinal Regression, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. Feature selection using chi-squared statistical test and correct tuning of hyperparameters maximized classification accuracy of the Support vector machine (Radial basis function) from 40% to 85%. By incorporating rules based on the statistical patterns observed, the efficiency was further enhanced to 95%. On the other side, seeing it as a 5-class classification, multi-class imbalance issue was addressed using suitable sampling techniques that resulted in 96% accuracy for 5-class data. We evaluated model efficiency using k-fold cross validation and confusion matrix. This study shows that the classification accuracy could be significantly improved by balancing the dataset using sampling and by properly tuning hyperparameters after feature selection. © 2020 B.

Generating specific resources for every domain independently requires high cost and extensive efforts. In response, we propose to build a general multi-class sentiment classifier using our Domain-Free Sentiment Multimedia Dataset (DFSMD). Based on the proven capabilities of Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) in dealing with high dimensional and imbalance data, we have trained an LGBM model to recognize one of three sentiments of tweets: positive, negative, or neutral. We have conducted extensive comparisons and evaluations for six other standard sentiment classification algorithms and different sets of features including OSNs-specific ones. Our results have shown that LGBM model is the winner among the other six algorithms. It has been also shown that our dataset contains distinguishing characteristics in the three classes. Moreover, hashtag words are shown to be significantly important in capturing the sentiments of tweets.

Supervised machine learning has proved to be a very useful tool to serve this purpose. Historical data of patients including clinical and demographic information is used for training learning algorithms. This builds predictive models that provide initial diagnoses. However, in the medical domain, it is common to have the positive class under-represented in a dataset. In such a scenario, a typical learning algorithm tends to be biased towards the negative class, which is the majority class, and misclassify positive cases. This is known as the class imbalance problem. In this paper, a framework for predictive diagnostics of diseases with imbalanced records is presented. To reduce the classification bias, we propose the usage of an overlap-based undersampling method to improve the visibility of minority class samples in the region where the two classes overlap. This is achieved by detecting and removing negative class instances from the overlapping region. This will improve class separability in the data space. Experimental results show achievement of high accuracy in the positive class, which is highly preferable in the medical domain, while good trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity were obtained. Results also show that the method often outperformed other state-of-the-art and well-established techniques. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Class overlap; Classification; Imbalanced data; Machine learning; Medical diagnosis; Medical prediction; Nearest neighbour; Undersampling","Springer"

However, along with the development of data collection, transmission, and storage technologies, the scale of the data has been sharply increased. Additionally, due to multiple classes and imbalanced data distribution in the dataset, the class imbalance issue is also gradually highlighted. The traditional machine learning algorithms lack of abilities for handling the aforementioned issues so that the classification efficiency and precision may be significantly impacted. Therefore, this paper presents an improved artificial neural network in enabling the high-performance classification for the imbalanced large volume data. Firstly, the Borderline-SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique) algorithm is employed to balance the training dataset, which potentially aims at improving the training of the back propagation neural network (BPNN), and then, zero-mean, batch-normalization, and rectified linear unit (ReLU) are further employed to optimize the input layer and hidden layers of BPNN. At last, the ensemble learning-based parallelization of the improved BPNN is implemented using the Hadoop framework. Positive conclusions can be summarized according to the experimental results. Benefitting from Borderline-SMOTE, the imbalanced training dataset can be balanced, which improves the training performance and the classification accuracy. The improvements for the input layer and hidden layer also enhance the training performances in terms of convergence. The parallelization and the ensemble learning techniques enable BPNN to implement the high-performance large-scale data classification.

Methods: We developed a deep archetypal analysis to identify patterns of glaucomatous vision loss, and then projected visual fields over the identified patterns. Projections provided a representation that was more accurate in detecting glaucomatous vision loss, thus, more appropriate for recognizing preclinical signs of glaucoma prior to disease development. To overcome the class imbalance in prediction, we implemented a class-balanced bagging with neural networks. Results: Using original visual field as features of the class-balanced bagging classification provided an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.55 for predicting glaucoma approximately four years prior to disease development. Using convex representation of the visual fields as input features provided an AUC of 0.61 while using deep convex representation as input features improved the AUC to 0.71. Relevance vector machine (RVM) achieved an AUC of 0.64. Conclusion: Deep archetypal analysis representation of visual functional features with balanced bagging classification could serve as an automated tool for predicting glaucoma. Significance: Glaucoma is the second leading cause of worldwide blindness. Most people with glaucoma have no early symptoms or pain, delaying diagnosis in many patients until they reach late irreversible vision loss stages. In fact, about 50% of people with glaucoma are unaware they have the disease.

Consequently, strong regularization methods are typically considered when training large-scale deep learning models for brain tumor segmentation to overcome undue bias towards representative tissue types. However, these regularization methods tend to be computationally exhaustive, and may not guarantee the learning of features representing all tumor tissue types that exist in the input MRI examples. Recent work in context encoding with deep CNN models have shown promise for semantic segmentation of natural scenes, with particular improvements in small object segmentation due to improved representative feature learning. Accordingly, we propose a novel, efficient 3DCNN based deep learning framework with context encoding for semantic brain tumor segmentation using multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (mMRI). The context encoding module in the proposed model enforces rich, class-dependent feature learning to improve the overall multi-label segmentation performance. We subsequently utilize context augmented features in a machine-learning based survival prediction pipeline to improve the prediction performance. The proposed method is evaluated using the publicly available 2019 Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) and survival prediction challenge dataset.

Having information about the redundancy, complexity and density of a problem allows us to make decisions as to which data preprocessing and machine learning techniques are most suitable. In classification problems, there are multiple metrics to describe the overlapping of the features between classes, class imbalances or separability, among others. However, these metrics may not scale up well when dealing with big datasets, or may not simply be sufficiently informative in this context. In this paper, we provide a package of metrics for big data classification problems. In particular, we propose two new big data metrics: Neighborhood Density and Decision Tree Progression, which study density and accuracy progression by discarding half of the samples. In addition, we enable a number of basic metrics to handle big data. The experimental study carried out in standard big data classification problems shows that our metrics can quickly characterize big datasets. We identified a clear redundancy of information in most datasets, so that, discarding randomly 75% of the samples does not drastically affect the accuracy of the classifiers used. Thus, the proposed big data metrics, which are available as a Spark-Package, provide a fast assessment of the shape of a classification dataset prior to applying big data preprocessing, toward smart data. © 2013 IEEE.","apache spark; Big data; classification; complexity; redundancy; smart data","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, performance degradation is mainly due to rare sub-concepts and overlapping of classes that could be analysed by looking at the local characteristics of the minority examples, rather than the imbalance of the whole dataset. We propose a new method for synthetic oversampling of multi-label data that focuses on local label distribution to generate more diverse and better labeled instances.

CAD systems based on deep learning have been developed to automate the process of mitosis classification. However, mitosis classification usually suffers from class imbalance problem, moreover, high similarity between mitotic and non-mitotic nuclei as well as discrepancy in appearance and shape make classification of mitotic nuclei a challenging area of research. Quality of CAD systems that use medical images for diagnosis, highly depends on how image features are manipulated in order to get better results. This work suggests a new technique of Channel Boosted Convolutional Neural Network (CB-CNN) to classify breast cancer mitotic nuclei. In this technique, feature representation of a CNN is boosted by adding auxiliary feature channels along with original feature space (Red, Green and Blue channels) to increase the generalization of model for heterogeneous and sparse data. In the proposed method, initially (80x80) patches of mitotic and non-mitotic nuclei were extracted from histopathological images by performing histogram based binary thresholding. For the development of a CB-CNN, the potential of auxiliary feature learners was exploited to learn high-level feature representation. In this regard, an additional set of texture and gradient based feature channels were concatenated with original RGB features space of data. This boosted representation was assigned to a custom made deep CNN model. Learning capacity of the proposed CB-CNN is evaluated on TUPAC'16 challenge dataset. Channel Boosting based CNNs (0.53 for CB-CNN, 0.71 for CB-VGG and 0.54 for CB-ResNet) show improved performance in terms of F-score as compared to SVM (F-score: 0.42), and baseline CNN (0.47 for CNN, 0.55 for VGG and 0.44 for ResNet) classifier with and without transfer learning. The improved performance of CB-CNN suggests that the boosting of channel representation improves the generalization of a CNN by making feature space more versatile and flexible, thus making it robust towards heterogeneous data. © 2020 IEEE.","Breast Cancer; Channel Boosted CNN; Channel Boosting; CNN; Deep Learning; Mitosis Classification","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

ADC performance has benefitted from using machine learning (ML) algorithms; however, performance is negatively affected by the data imbalance and limited amounts of training data. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is an oversampling technique to adjust the skewed class distribution of a dataset so that the bias of the majority class is reduced. This paper shows that applying SMOTE achieved higher accuracy and purity on two imbalanced datasets, consisting of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images collected with ASML-HMI eP™ and eScan® series inspection tools. The ML models are also less sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters when SMOTE is applied. We also show that better classification results can be obtained with less training samples with SMOTE; we conducted an experiment where a ML model trained on only 25% of samples with SMOTE achieved a higher ADC accuracy and purity performance compared to the same ML model trained on all samples but without SMOTE. In another experiment using a highly imbalanced SEM dataset with very few counts of the defect-of-interest (DOI), the combination of SMOTE and random undersampling of the majority class improves the accuracy by up to 5x while maintaining the same level of purity. © 2020 SPIE.","Automatic Defect Classification; Image classification; Imbalanced dataset; Machine learning; Semiconductor wafer inspection; SMOTE","SPIE"

Tridosha defines the three basic energies or principles that determine the function of our body on the physical and emotional levels. The three energies are known as VATT, PITT and KAPH. Each individual has a unique balance of all three of these energies. Some people will be predominant in one, while others will be a mixture of two or more. Ayurveda-dosha studies have been used for a long time, but the quantitative reliability measurement of these diagnostic methods still lags behind. A careful and appropriate analysis leads to an effective treatment. To collect a meaningful data set, a questionnaire with 28 different characteristics is validated by Ayurveda experts. Authors calculate Cronbach alpha of VATT-Dosha, PITT-Dosha and KAPH-Dosha as 0.94, 0.98 and 0.98, respectively to check the reliability of the questionnaire. Authors analyzed questionnaires of 807 healthy persons aged 20-60 years and found 62.1% men and 37.9% women. The class imbalance problem is resolved with oversampling and the equally distributed data set of randomly selected 405 persons is used for the actual experiment. Using computer algorithms, we randomly divide the data set (8:2) into a training set of 324 persons and a test data set of 81 persons. Model is trained using traditional machine learning techniques for classification analysis as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and Decision Tree (DT). System is also implemented using ensemble of several machine learning methods for constitution recognition. Evaluation measures of classification such as root mean square error (RMSE), precision, recall, F-score, and accuracy is calculated and analyzed. On analyzing the results authors find that the data is best trained and tested with CatBoost, which is tuned with hyper parameters and achieves 0.96 precision, 0.95 recall, 0.95 F-score and 0.95 accuracy rate.

We propose a novel framework for training base classifiers and preparing the dynamic selection dataset (DSEL) to integrate data preprocessing and dynamic ensemble selection (DES) methods for imbalanced data stream classification. The proposed approach has been evaluated on the basis of computer experiments carried out on 72 artificially generated data streams with various imbalance ratios, levels of label noise and types of concept drift. In addition, we consider six variations of preprocessing methods and four DES methods. Experimentation results showed that dynamic ensemble selection, even without the use of any data preprocessing, can outperform a naive combination of the whole pool generated with the use of preprocessing methods.

These big data sources often contain a plethora of useful information but, in some cases, finding what is actually useful can be quite problematic. For binary classification problems, such as fraud detection, a major concern therein is one of class imbalance. This is when a dataset has more of one label versus another, such as a large number of non-fraud observations with comparatively few observations of fraud (which we consider the class of interest). Class rarity further delineates class imbalance with significantly smaller numbers in the class of interest. In this study, we assess the impacts of class rarity in big data, and apply data sampling to mitigate some of the performance degradation caused by rarity. Real-world Medicare claims datasets with known excluded providers are used as fraud labels for a fraud detection scenario, incorporating three machine learning models. We discuss the necessary data processing and engineering steps in order to understand, integrate, and use the Medicare data. From these already imbalanced datasets, we generate three additional datasets representing varying levels of class rarity.

Because the ionome is a function of genetics and environmental conditions, practitioners aim at fine-tuning fertilization to obtain an optimal ionome based on the needs of potato cultivars. Our objective was to assess the validity of cultivar grouping and predict potato tuber yields using foliar ionomes. The dataset comprised 3382 observations in Québec (Canada) from 1970 to 2017. The first mature leaves from top were sampled at the beginning of flowering for total N, P, K, Ca, and Mg analysis. We preprocessed nutrient concentrations (ionomes) by centering each nutrient to the geometric mean of all nutrients and to a filling value, a transformation known as row-centered log ratios (clr). A densitybased clustering algorithm (dbscan) on these preprocessed ionomes failed to delineate groups of high-yield cultivars. We also used the preprocessed ionomes to assess their effects on tuber yield classes (high- and low-yields) on a cultivar basis using k-nearest neighbors, random forest and support vector machines classification algorithms. Our machine learning models returned an average accuracy of 70%, a fair diagnostic potential to detect in-season nutrient imbalance of potato cultivars using clr variables considering potential confounding factors.

The widely used bot detection method based on machine learning leads to an imbalance in the number of samples in different categories. Classifier bias leads to a low detection rate of minority samples. Therefore, we propose an improved conditional generative adversarial network (improved CGAN) to extend imbalanced data sets before applying training classifiers to improve the detection accuracy of social bots. To generate an auxiliary condition, we propose a modified clustering algorithm, namely, the Gaussian kernel density peak clustering algorithm (GKDPCA), which avoids the generation of data-augmentation noise and eliminates imbalances between and within social bot class distributions. Furthermore, we improve the CGAN convergence judgment condition by introducing the Wasserstein distance with a gradient penalty, which addresses the model collapse and gradient disappearance in the traditional CGAN. Three common oversampling algorithms are compared in experiments. The effects of the imbalance degree and the expansion ratio of the original data on oversampling are studied, and the improved CGAN performs better than the others. Experimental results comparing with three common oversampling algorithms show that the improved CGAN achieves the higher evaluation scores in terms of F1-score, G-mean and AUC. © 2013 IEEE.","conditional generative adversarial networks; data augmentation; imbalanced data; Social bot detection; supervised classification","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, there are various factors that make it difficult to apply in reality, even though algorithms for detecting various faults have been studied. The class imbalance problem is considered one of the most serious problems with fault detection. In many areas of classification, the data collected is largely imbalanced. Thus, in order to actually apply data-based system monitoring, there is a need for a method that can effectively solve such class imbalances. Various methodologies have been proposed to address this class imbalance problem, and good results have been recorded in several studies.

As with many other diseases, early diagnosis can help to provide patients with proper care to minimize the damage produced by the disease, or to isolate them to avoid the risk of spread. In this context, computational intelligence can be useful to predict the risk of infection in patients, raising early alarms that can aid medical teams to respond as quick as possible. In this paper, we survey the state of the art on infection prediction using computer science by means of a systematic literature review. The objective is to find papers where computational intelligence is used to predict infections in patients using physiological data as features. We have posed one major research question along with nine specific subquestions. The whole review process is thoroughly described, and eight databases are considered which index most of the literature published in different scholarly formats. A total of 101 relevant documents have been found in the period comprised between 2003 and 2019, and a detailed study of these documents is carried out to classify the works and answer the research questions posed, resulting to our best knowledge in the most comprehensive study of its kind. We conclude that the most widely addressed infection is by far sepsis, followed by Clostridium difficile infection and surgical site infections. Most works use machine learning techniques, from which logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest and naive Bayes are the most common. Some machine learning works provide some ideas on the problems of small data and class imbalance, which can be of interest. The current systematic literature review shows that automatic diagnosis of infectious diseases using computational intelligence is well documented in the medical literature. © 2013 IEEE.","Computational intelligence; expert systems; infection prediction; machine learning; physiological signals; systematic literature review","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Weaknesses of the servers enable hackers to intrude on computers by using not only known but also new attack-types, which are more sophisticated and harder to detect. To protect the computers from them, Intrusion Detection System (IDS), which is trained with some machine learning techniques by using a pre-collected dataset, is one of the most preferred protection mechanisms. The used datasets were collected during a limited period in some specific networks and generally don't contain up-to-date data. Additionally, they are imbalanced and cannot hold sufficient data for all types of attacks. These imbalanced and outdated datasets decrease the efficiency of current IDSs, especially for rarely encountered attack types. In this paper, we propose six machine-learning-based IDSs by using K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Adaboost, Decision Tree, and Linear Discriminant Analysis algorithms. To implement a more realistic IDS, an up-to-date security dataset, CSE-CIC-IDS2018, is used instead of older and mostly worked datasets. The selected dataset is also imbalanced. Therefore, to increase the efficiency of the system depending on attack types and to decrease missed intrusions and false alarms, the imbalance ratio is reduced by using a synthetic data generation model called Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE). Data generation is performed for minor classes, and their numbers are increased to the average data size via this technique. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach considerably increases the detection rate for rarely encountered intrusions. © 2013 IEEE.","CSE-CIC-IDS2018; IDS; imbalanced dataset; intrusion detection; machine learning; SMOTE","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

A multivariate linear regression model is developed and trained with device parameter data (as input) and current imbalance data (as label). Each of the training devices is successively paralleled with one reference device to generate the current imbalance (label) data. Devices with close values of current imbalance when individually paralleled with the reference device are expected to have relatively balanced current sharing when paralleled among themselves. This model is trained with 40 devices and tested with 20 devices. The model shows accuracies of 87.93% and 97.48% in predicting transient and steady state current imbalances, respectively. These accuracy values are obtained by comparing the model’s prediction for the 20 testing devices with the actual current imbalance values when these devices are paralleled with a reference device. Based on current imbalance predictions made by these models, the devices are grouped into classes for paralleling applications. The selection of devices for paralleling based on predictions from these models result in a satisfactorily balanced current distribution. The model’s performance at higher temperatures is also satisfactory. © 2019, The Korean Institute of Power Electronics.","Current imbalance; Machine learning; Multivariate linear regression; Paralleling; SiC MOSFET; Sorting","Springer"

Unlike traditional prediction, we study the problem of convective storm nowcasting from the perspective of machine learning. First, this paper divides the research area into a number of position-fixed small cells, then transforms the nowcasting problem into a question: Is there a radar echo > 35 dBZ in a cell within 30 minutes? Secondly, the problem of nowcasting is formulated as a kind of spatiotemporal classification learning. From this point of view, this paper introduces a sliding oversampling method to mitigate the class imbalance issue of convective storm nowcasting. A spatiotemporal convolutional network nowcasting method is proposed which is in less computational cost and easier to train than recurrent neural network. In experiments, this spatiotemporal convolution network can better captures temporal and spatial correlations, compared with previous studies, therefore results in better predictive performance. Although no sophisticated tracking algorithms are used, storm movement trends and storm growth can be predicted with reasonable skill. © 2019 SPIE.","Convective nowcasting; Convolutional neural network; Machine learning; Spatiotemporal sequence","SPIE"

Ones of the reasons behind this strong performance of NBC is the assumptions of conditional Independences among the initial parameters and the predictors.

To optimize for this metric, we introduce the Real-World-Weight Cross-Entropy loss function, in both binary classification and single-label multiclass classification variants. Both variants allow direct input of real world costs as weights. For single-label, multiclass classification, our loss function also allows direct penalization of probabilistic false positives, weighted by label, during the training of a machine learning model. We compare the design of our loss function to the binary cross-entropy and categorical cross-entropy functions, as well as their weighted variants, to discuss the potential for improvement in handling a variety of known shortcomings of machine learning, ranging from imbalanced classes to medical diagnostic error to reinforcement of social bias.

In this paper, we present a pipeline that uses GANs in an unsupervised image translation environment to improve learning with respect to the data distribution in a plant disease dataset, reducing the partiality introduced by acute class imbalance and hence shifting the classification decision boundary towards better performance. The empirical analysis of our method is demonstrated on a limited dataset of 2789 tomato plant disease images, highly corrupted with an imbalance in the 9 disease categories. First, we extend the state of the art for the GAN-based image-to-image translation method by enhancing the perceptual quality of the generated images and preserving the semantics. We introduce AR-GAN, where in addition to the adversarial loss, our synthetic image generator optimizes on Activation Reconstruction loss (ARL) function that optimizes feature activations against the natural image. We present visually more compelling synthetic images in comparison to most prominent existing models and evaluate the performance of our GAN framework in terms of various datasets and metrics. Second, we evaluate the performance of a baseline convolutional neural network classifier for improved recognition using the resulting synthetic samples to augment our training set and compare it with the classical data augmentation scheme.

In this paper, we combine multimodal features based on local field potentials (LFPs) and spike signals to detect bad channels automatically using machine learning. On the basis of 2632 pairs of LFPs and spike recordings acquired from five pigeons, 12 multimodal features are used to quantify each channel's temporal, frequency, phase and firing-rate properties. We implement seven classifiers in the detection tasks, in which the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) system and Fisher weighted Euclidean distance sorting (FWEDS) are used to cope with the class imbalance problem. The results of the two-dimensional scatterplots and classifications demonstrate that correlation coefficient, phase locking value, and coherence have good discriminability. For the multimodal features, almost all the classifiers can obtain high accuracy and bad channel detection rate after the SMOTE operation, in which the Random Forests classifier shows relatively better comprehensive performance (accuracy: 0.9092 ± 0.0081, precision: 0.9123 ± 0.0100, and recall: 0.9057 ± 0.0121).

Similarly to statistical inference models, also ML models are subject to the common problem of class imbalance. Therefore, they are affected by the majority class increasing the false negative rate.

In essence, the challenge is to build up a robust methodology to perform a reliable morphological estimate from galaxy images. Here, we investigate how to substantially improve the galaxy classification within large datasets by mimicking human classification. We combine accurate visual classifications from the Galaxy Zoo project with machine and deep learning methodologies. We propose two distinct approaches for galaxy morphology: one based on non-parametric morphology and traditional machine learning algorithms; and another based on Deep Learning. To measure the input features for the traditional machine learning methodology, we have developed a system called CyMorph, with a novel non-parametric approach to study galaxy morphology. The main datasets employed comes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7). We also discuss the class imbalance problem considering three classes. Performance of each model is mainly measured by Overall Accuracy (OA). A spectroscopic validation with astrophysical parameters is also provided for Decision Tree models to assess the quality of our morphological classification. In all of our samples, both Deep and Traditional Machine Learning approaches have over 94.5% OA to classify galaxies in two classes (elliptical and spiral). We compare our classification with state-of-the-art morphological classification from literature.

Due to the nature of network intrusions the datasets available for training machine learning algorithms, i.e. classifiers, is imbalanced, due to some attacks being rare and some being frequent, in practice. For example, the most widely used network Intrusion Detection System (IDS) dataset is the KDD cup 99 dataset which is known to be an imbalanced dataset, meaning that there is a considerable imbalance amongst the number of occurrences of attacks (i.e. instances) in the different dataset classes. Thus, the resulting data complexity (e.g., irrelevant features, class imbalance) influences how effective a learning task would be when this dataset is used to train a machine learning classifier. In a typical machine learning based IDS a minimum of two pre-processing stages is utilized, i.e. data resampling and feature selection, within the system’s data pre-processing pipeline. The impact of data resampling and feature selection, separately on the performance accuracy of classifiers has been investigated in detail in literature. However, the question of whether feature selection should be performed after or before resampling methods for tackling imbalanced datasets such as the KDD cup dataset, has not been investigated. Further the impact of this order of algorithms within the data pre-processing pipeline, on the performance of different classifiers has also not been studied. This paper centres on the dual utilisation of resampling techniques and feature selection approaches within a data pre-processing pipeline of an IDS, and explores which one, when implemented in what order, would achieve the superior classification results for a given classifier. Seven feature selection methods are studied alongside a most widely used resampling technique. The impact on three widely used classification algorithms are investigated; Naïve Bayes, Random Forest and Stacking. The performance of classifiers is examined in detail to determine which should come first, resampling or feature selection. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Feature selection; Imbalanced dataset; Intrusion detection; Machine learning; Resample","Springer Verlag"

While the common metrics require a balanced class distribution, our proposed metrics evaluate the document terms under an imbalanced distribution. They calculate the degree of relatedness of terms with respect to minor and major classes by considering their imbalanced distribution. Using these metrics in the document representation makes a better distinction between the documents of the minor and major classes and improves the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Interpolation-based oversampling techniques solve this problem by yielding the synthetic minority samples to correct the imbalanced class distribution, which has become one of the most popular types of solutions. However, several non-negligible drawbacks exist in them. This study identifies that the flaws of the over constraint, low-efficiency expansion, and over generalization can occur when interpolating the synthetic samples for the inland minority samples (resided in the interior of dense regions of minority class), borderline minority samples (settled in the border of dense regions), and trapped minority samples (located in the sparse regions), respectively. To overcome these flaws, a Position characteristic-Aware Interpolation Oversampling algorithm (PAIO) is proposed. PAIO first leverages a neighborhood-based clustering algorithm to divide the minority samples into three types of samples with different position characteristics (i.e., the inland minority, borderline minority, and trapped minority samples). It then carries out ad hoc interpolation oversampling for these three different types of minority samples, so that the deficiencies can be addressed correspondingly. Moreover, another drawback in interpolation-base oversampling algorithms is the groundless populating for the categorical attributes of synthetic samples. To solve this problem, we develop a Generalized Interpolation Creation way (GIC) to fill the categorical attributes.

The datasets that have skewed class distribution pose hindrance to conventional learning methods. Conventional learning methods give the same importance to all the samples. This leads to biased accuracy, which favors the majority classes. Several classifiers have been designed to tackle the class imbalance problems. Weighted kernel-based SMOTE (WKSMOTE) is a recently proposed method, which employs the minority oversampling in kernel space to tackle the class imbalance problem. Motivated by WKSMOTE, this work proposes a novel SMOTE based class-specific extreme learning machine (SMOTE-CSELM), a variant of class-specific extreme learning machine (CS-ELM), which exploits the benefit of both the minority oversampling and the class-specific regularization. For minority oversampling, this work uses synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). It increases the significance of the minority class samples for determining the decision region of the classifiers. The proposed method has comparable computational complexity than the weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) for imbalanced learning. The extensive experimental results evaluated on the real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Class-specific extreme learning machine; Class-specific regularization; Classification; Imbalanced learning; SMOTE","Elsevier B.V."

Despite rapid development in miRNA research, precise experimental methods to determine miRNA target interactions are still lacking. This motivated us to explore the in silico target interaction features and incorporate them in predictive modeling. We propose a systematic approach towards developing a sensitive miRNA target prediction model to explore the interplay of target recognition features. In the first step, we have employed a supervised ensemble under-sampling approach to address the problem of imbalance in the training dataset due to a larger number of negative instances. Various feature selection techniques were evaluated to obtain the optimal feature subset that best recognizes the true miRNA-mRNA targets.

Specifically, we consider how to achieve fast and accurate patient Triage in the ED of a pediatric hospital. The goal of this paper is to establish methodological best practices for the application of machine learning (ML) to Triage in pediatric ED, providing a comprehensive comparison of the performance of ML techniques over a large dataset. Our work is among the first attempts in this direction. Following very recent works in the literature, we use the clinical outcome of a case as its label for supervised ML model training, instead of the more uncertain labels provided by experts. The experimental dataset contains the records along 3 years of operation of the hospital ED. It consists of 189,718 patients visits to the hospital. The clinical outcome of 9271 cases (4.98%) wa hospital admission, therefore our dataset is highly class imbalanced. Our reported performance comparison results focus on four ML models: Deep Learning (DL), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Data preprocessing includes class imbalance correction, and case re-labeling. We use different well known metrics to evaluate performance of ML models in three different experimental settings: (a) classification of each case into the standard five Triage urgency levels, (b) discrimination of high versus low case severity according to its clinical outcome, and (c) comparison of the number of patients assigned to each standard Triage urgency level against the Triage rule based expert system currently in use at the hospital. RF achieved greater AUC, accuracy, PPV and specificity than the other models in the dychotomic classification experiments. On the implementation side, our study shows that ML predictive models trained according to clinical outcomes, provide better Triage performance than the current rule based expert system in operation at the hospital. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Clinical decision support systems; Data science; Emergency department; Machine learning; Triage","Elsevier Ltd"

Hence, this study aimed to assess the application of filter feature selection techniques on text data. In this study, features were ranked from highest to lowest by the selected filter feature selection methods in each generated feature subset. Thereafter, a new feature subset was obtained using the proposed method. This study yielded that the accuracy of Information Gain is 1.12 percentage points higher in comparison to the accuracy of Chi-square. Moreover, classification accuracy obtained from aggregation exhibits a rise of 0.93 percentage points compared to the accuracy of Information Gain and 2.05 percentage points against Chi-square. Classification accuracy improved when the features are aggregated. On Precision, in comparison to that of the aggregation, results show the differences in percentage points of 1.41 and significant 11.64 for Information Gain and Chi-square respectively. About Recall, there is a 5.54 percentage points improvement on Information Gain and 3.03 percentage points improvement on Chi-square. Then, in F1, the score for aggregation is quite low. It may mean that the classifier has problems with false positives or false negatives. Thus, the classifier needs to be checked using a confusion matrix or check on the dataset, which was not done in the experiment. Dataset imbalance was also not addressed in this study. For future work, the imbalanced class-dataset issue should be addressed. Also, the performance of other filter methods could be compared as well as utilize other classifiers that support multiclass tasks to determine which is suitable for multiclass text classification. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Aggregation; Filter feature selection; Machine learning; Multiclass; Text classification","Association for Computing Machinery"

TLR9 activates the innate immune system following the recognition of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN) containing unmethylated cytosine-guanine (CpG) motifs. Due to the considerable number of rotatable bonds in ODNs, high-throughput in silico screening for potential TLR9 activity via traditional structure-based virtual screening approaches of CpG ODNs is challenging. In the current study, we present a machine learning based method for predicting novel mouse TLR9 (mTLR9) agonists based on features including count and position of motifs, the distance between the motifs and graphically derived features such as the radius of gyration and moment of Inertia. We employed an in-house experimentally validated dataset of 396 single-stranded synthetic ODNs, to compare the results of five machine learning algorithms. Since the dataset was highly imbalanced, we used an ensemble learning approach based on repeated random down-sampling. Results: Using in-house experimental TLR9 activity data we found that random forest algorithm outperformed other algorithms for our dataset for TLR9 activity prediction. Therefore, we developed a cross-validated ensemble classifier of 20 random forest models. The average Matthews correlation coefficient and balanced accuracy of our ensemble classifier in test samples was 0.61 and 80.0%, respectively, with the maximum balanced accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient of 87.0% and 0.75, respectively. We confirmed common sequence motifs including 'CC', 'GG','AG', 'CCCG' and 'CGGC' were overrepresented in mTLR9 agonists. Predictions on 6000 randomly generated ODNs were ranked and the top 100 ODNs were synthesized and experimentally tested for activity in a mTLR9 reporter cell assay, with 91 of the 100 selected ODNs showing high activity, confirming the accuracy of the model in predicting mTLR9 activity. Conclusion: We combined repeated random down-sampling with random forest to overcome the class imbalance problem and achieved promising results. Overall, we showed that the random forest algorithm outperformed other machine learning algorithms including support vector machines, shrinkage discriminant analysis, gradient boosting machine and neural networks. Due to its predictive performance and simplicity, the random forest technique is a useful method for prediction of mTLR9 ODN agonists. © 2019 The Author(s).","CpG; CpG; Imbalanced data; Machine learning; Oligonucleotides; Random Forest; Toll-like receptor 9","BioMed Central Ltd."

Past research has relied overwhelmingly on logistic regression analysis (LR) that predicts post-fire tree status as a binary outcome (i.e. living or dead). One of the most problematic issues for LR (or any classification problem) occurs when there is a class imbalance in the training data. In these instances, predictions will be biased toward the majority class. Using a historical prescribed fire data set of longleaf pines (Pinus palustris) from northern Florida, USA, we compare results from standard LR and the machine-learning algorithm, random forest (RF). First, we demonstrate the class imbalance problem using simulated data. We then show how a balanced RF model can be used to alleviate the bias in the model and improve mortality prediction results. In the simulated example, LR model sensitivity and specificity was clearly biased based on the degree of imbalance between the classes. The balanced RF models had consistent sensitivity and specificity throughout the simulated data sets. Re-analyzing the original longleaf pine data set with a balanced RF model showed that although both LR and RF models had similar areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC), the RF model had better discrimination for predicting new observations of dead trees. Both LR and RF models identified duff consumption and percent crown scorch as important predictors of tree mortality, however the RF model also suggested pre-fire duff depth as an important predictor. Our analysis highlights LR limitations when data are imbalanced and supports using RF to develop post-fire tree mortality models. We suggest how RF can be incorporated into future tree mortality studies, as well as possible implementation in future decision-support tools. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fire effects; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Model evaluation; Model validation; Pinus palustris; Prescribed fire","Elsevier B.V."

Using erroneous data such as data with missing values, class imbalance, and skew, may affect model performance and classification outcome. Often when models have poor performance, practitioners focus on improving models but overlook quality processing as it requires the involvement of data experts or data owners who have an intimate understanding of the data. Furthermore, performing data quality processing is challenging in that there is no one-size-fits-all optimal solution that is suitable for all types of data and models. Therefore, a unique combination of data quality processing methods is required for each dataset and model prior to model generation in order to identify the most appropriate set of methods that can improve the model's performance in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall. Finding the most effective way to prepare data requires many manual iterations of trial and error. In this paper, we design and develop Sweeper, a tool that automatically explores combinations of many data quality processing methods and models to rank and identify the most suitable one for the given data.

The intensity and frequency of these attacks are increasing at an alarming rate. With the promising results presented by Machine Learning (ML) techniques in variety fields, researchers have proposed numerous intelligent schemes to defend against DDoS attacks and mitigate their impact. This paper presents a taxonomy of the ML-based DDoS detection schemes, focusing on the important features and mechanisms that each scheme uses to detect and mitigate the impact of these attacks. The taxonomy is developed based on a thorough and extensive review of the literature, focusing on the most prominent and highly cited schemes that have been proposed over the last decade. The taxonomy is then used as a basis for the development of a framework to conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the basic mechanisms underling the design of the selected ML-based DDoS defense schemes against a variety of attack scenarios. Rather than dealing with the specific details of a particular DDoS defense scheme, this work focuses on the “building blocks” of the intelligent DDoS detection and prevention schemes. The intelligent mechanisms underlying the selected schemes are implemented and evaluated using different performance metrics. The impact of different influential factors are also explored, including the observable traffic proportions, attack intensities and the “Class Imbalance Problem” of ML-based DDoS detection. The results of the comparative analysis show that no single technique outperforms all others in all test cases. Furthermore, the results underscore the need for a method oriented feature selection model to enhance the capabilities of ML-based detection techniques. Finally, the results show that the class imbalance problem significantly impact performance, underscoring the need for further research to address this problem and ensure high-quality DDoS detection in real-time. © 2019","DDoS detection review; Empirical analysis; Machine learning","Elsevier B.V."

We used 22,999 annotated tweets to train and evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms—feature-engineered and deep learning-based classifiers—that automatically distinguish tweets referring to the user’s pregnancy outcome from tweets that merely mention birth defects. Because 90% of the tweets merely mention birth defects, we experimented with under-sampling and over-sampling approaches to address this class imbalance. An SVM classifier achieved the best performance for the two positive classes: an F1-score of 0.65 for the “defect” class and 0.51 for the “possible defect” class. We deployed the classifier on 20,457 unlabeled tweets that mention birth defects, which helped identify 542 additional users for potential inclusion in our cohort.

However, with the increasing adoption of Internet applications use encryption protocols to transmit data, traffic classification is becoming more difficult. Although existing machine learning methods and novel deep learning methods have many advantages, which can solve the drawbacks of port and payload based methods, but there are still some shortcomings, one of which is the imbalanced property of network traffic data. In this paper, we proposed a GAN based method called FlowGAN to tackle with the problem of class imbalance for traffic classification.

Furthermore, we trained a classical deep learning model, Multilayer perceptron (MLP) based network traffic classifier to evaluate the performance of FlowGAN. Based on the public dataset 'ISCX', our experimental results show that our proposed FlowGAN can outperform an unbalanced dataset and balancing dataset by the oversampling method in terms of data augmentation.

It plays a vital role in growth of a company. Among those companies, telecommunication industry is a prominent industry where upselling is highly influenced on churn reduction and stabilizing the customer base. As this increases the satisfaction of customers through adding products and services it is very effective in a marketing perspective. In a typical 4G LTE package marketing, customer will be offered to select a fixed package out of a set of pre-defined packages. The decision of selecting a suitable package by customer will be mainly an instinct driven decision due to lack of previous experience of using an LTE package. This will result in selecting an unsuitable package, which will lead to over usage of data. As a result, it will cause customer dissatisfaction and loss of potential income for the company. Therefore, it is essential for a telecommunication company to identify the customers who have the potential to upgrade their packages based on customer usage. In this research, potential package upgrades are predicted for LTE broadband users through a supervised learning method using different classification models. One of the key factors on obtaining a high accuracy model for classifying customers is to address the class imbalance problem that is present in the telecommunication data. The ratio between potential package upgrades and normal customers is highly skewed towards normal customers. This is addressed using SMOTE which is an oversampling method that creates synthetic samples using existing data points. Potential customers identified by a classification model trained by a dataset consist of usage behavior.

These samples are often overlooked by the traditional oversampling methods or the nearest negative samples are often removed to increase positive prediction rate- while sacrificing the negative prediction rate. This work demonstrates that by only oversampling the Borderline, Rare and Outlier samples at different rate, better performance can be achieved than all other pre-processing methods.

Within this topic, different class definitions of clean and unclean are introduced and a distinction is made between a combined prediction model that includes the entire environment and restroom specific prediction models that focus only on a single restroom.

Sampling methods do not improve the performance of the combined prediction model but do improve the performance of some of the restroom-specific prediction models, especially those with a high class imbalance.

The existing works generally apply dimension reduction methods to reduce the dimensionality of features first, and then deal with the class imbalance problem by traditional imbalanced learning technologies. However, dimensionality reduction may cause the loss of useful information and cannot effectively address the problem of hubness which is an important aspect of the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we present a hubness-aware cluster-based ensemble algorithm, HUSBoost, for learning high- dimensional imbalanced data. For hubs induced by high dimensionality, HUSBoost introduces discount factors to slow down the excessive growth of their weights, so as to alleviate the negative impacts of 'bad' hubs on the classification decisions of component classifiers. To address the class imbalance problem, HUSBoost utilizes a cluster-based majority undersampling method to correct imbalanced class distribution. Specifically, k- hubs clustering technology is used to divide the majority samples into multiple clusters, and then the representative majority samples are selected from each cluster so as to form the balanced class distribution.

Various methods for addressing class imbalance have been introduced, including algorithm-level methods, datalevel methods, and hybrid methods. While these methods are well studied using traditional machine learning algorithms, there are relatively few studies that explore their application to deep neural networks. Thresholding, in particular, is rarely discussed in the deep learning with class imbalance literature. This paper addresses this gap by conducting a systematic study on the application of thresholding with deep neural networks using a Big Data Medicare fraud data set. We use random oversampling (ROS), random under-sampling (RUS), and a hybrid ROS-RUS to create 15 training distributions with varying levels of class imbalance. With the fraudulent class size ranging from 0.03%-60%, we identify optimal classification thresholds for each distribution on random validation sets and then score the thresholds on a 20% holdout test set. Through repetition and statistical analysis, confidence intervals show that the default threshold is never optimal when training data is imbalanced. Results also show that the optimal threshold outperforms the default threshold in nearly all cases, and linear models indicate a strong linear relationship between the minority class size and the optimal decision threshold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide statistical results that describe optimal classification thresholds for deep neural networks over a range of class distributions. © 2019 IEEE.","Artificial Neural Networks; Class Imbalance; Data Sampling; Deep Learning; Fraud Detection; Thresholding","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Recently, new imbalanced learning techniques have been proposed in the literature, and they can improve the credit scoring results. Motivated by this scenario, we evaluate several classification approaches to credit scoring. Besides, we also assess some preprocessing methods to overcome skewed datasets. To achieve it, we use three public real-world credit scoring datasets. In our experiments, we progressively increase the class imbalance in each of these datasets by randomly undersampling the minority class of defaulters to identify how the predictive power is affected. The results indicate that random forest, extreme gradient boosting perform very well in all imbalance levels. We also find that a complete grid search step can increase the prediction power of classification approaches in high imbalanced datasets. © 2019 IEEE.","Benchmarking; Classification; Credit scoring; Imbalanced datasets","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

With the advent of astronomical instruments, the volume and rate of data acquisition have grown exponentially. This development necessitates a focus on artificial intelligence (AI) technologies that can mine large astronomical data sets. Automatic pulsar candidate identification (APCI) can be considered as a task determining potential candidates for further investigation and eliminating the noise of radio-frequency interference and other non-pulsar signals. As reported in the existing literature, AI techniques, especially convolutional neural network (CNN)-based techniques, have been adopted for APCI. However, it is challenging to enhance the performance of CNN-based pulsar identification because only an extremely limited number of real pulsar samples exist, which results in a crucial class imbalance problem. To address these problems, we propose a framework that combines a deep convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN) with a support vector machine (SVM). The DCGAN is used as a sample generation and feature learning model, and the SVM is adopted as the classifier for predicting the label of a candidate at the inference stage. The proposed framework is a novel technique, which not only can solve the class imbalance problem but also can learn the discriminative feature representations of pulsar candidates instead of computing handcrafted features in the pre-processing steps. The proposed method can enhance the accuracy of the APCI, and the computer experiments performed on two pulsar data sets verified the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. © 2019 The Author(s)","Methods: data analysis; Methods: numerical; Methods: statistical; Pulsars: general","Oxford University Press"

Most of sampling and example generation approaches just focused on inter-class imbalanced defect data, and they are not effective to handle the issue of intra-class imbalance. This paper proposed a distribution based data generation approach for software defect prediction to deal with inter-class and intra-class imbalanced data simultaneously. First, the classified sub-regions are clustered according to the distribution in the sample feature space. Second, the data are generated by corresponding strategies according to different distribution in sub-regions, where the inter-class balance is achieved by increasing the number of defective samples, and the intra-class balance is achieved by generating different density of data in different sub-regions.

To solve this problem, focusing on the data rebalancing algorithm of SMOTE(synthetic minority oversampling technique), taking the intrusion detection data set KDD99 as the original training set, a simple sampling method and SMOTE algorithm were used to generate the rebalancing training set. And then, a variety of machine learning models were used to perform 5 fold cross-validation for the original training set and the rebalanced training set respectively. Experimental results show that, compared with the original training set, the use of rebalancing training set modeling can improve the recognition accuracy and recall rate of the minor class samples by about 10%~20% without reducing or even improving the recognition effect of major class samples.

The Gleason score is a pathological grading system to examine the potential aggressiveness of the disease in the prostate tissue. Advancements in computing and next-generation sequencing technology now allow us to study the genomic profiles of patients in association with their different Gleason scores more accurately and effectively. (2) Methods: In this study, we used a novel machine learning method to analyse gene expression of prostate tumours with different Gleason scores, and identify potential genetic biomarkers for each Gleason group. We obtained a publicly-available RNA-Seq dataset of a cohort of 104 prostate cancer patients from the National Center for Biotechnology Information's (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository, and categorised patients based on their Gleason scores to create a hierarchy of disease progression. A hierarchical model with standard classifiers in different Gleason groups, also known as nodes, was developed to identify and predict nodes based on their mRNA or gene expression. In each node, patient samples were analysed via class imbalance and hybrid feature selection techniques to build the prediction model. The outcome from analysis of each node was a set of genes that could differentiate each Gleason group from the remaining groups. To validate the proposed method, the set of identified genes were used to classify a second dataset of 499 prostate cancer patients collected from cBioportal. (3) Results: The overall accuracy of applying this novel method to the first dataset was 93.3%; the method was further validated to have 87% accuracy using the second dataset. This method also identified genes that were not previously reported as potential biomarkers for specific Gleason groups. In particular, PIAS3 was identified as a potential biomarker for Gleason score 4 + 3 = 7, and UBE2V2 for Gleason score 6. (4) Insight: Previous reports show that the genes predicted by this newly proposed method strongly correlate with prostate cancer development and progression. Furthermore, pathway analysis shows that both PIAS3 and UBE2V2 share similar protein interaction pathways, the JAK/STAT signaling process. © 2019 by the authors.","Classification; Gleason score detection; Next generation sequencing; Prostate cancer; Supervised learning; Transcriptomics","MDPI"

Where the minority (positive) class holds greater value than the majority (negative) class and the occurrence of false negatives incurs a greater penalty than false positives, the bias may lead to adverse consequences. Our paper incorporates two case studies, each utilizing three learners, six sampling approaches, two performance metrics, and five sampled distribution ratios, to uniquely investigate the effect of severe class imbalance on Big Data analytics. The learners (Gradient-Boosted Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest) were implemented within the Apache Spark framework. The first case study is based on a Medicare fraud detection dataset. The second case study, unlike the first, includes training data from one source (SlowlorisBig Dataset) and test data from a separate source (POST dataset). Results from the Medicare case study are not conclusive regarding the best sampling approach using Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Geometric Mean performance metrics. However, it should be noted that the Random Undersampling approach performs adequately in the first case study. For the SlowlorisBig case study, Random Undersampling convincingly outperforms the other five sampling approaches (Random Oversampling, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling TEchnique, SMOTE-borderline1 , SMOTE-borderline2 , ADAptive SYNthetic) when measuring performance with Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve and Geometric Mean metrics. Based on its classification performance in both case studies, Random Undersampling is the best choice as it results in models with a significantly smaller number of samples, thus reducing computational burden and training time. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big Data; Class imbalance; Machine Learning; Medicare fraud; Oversampling; SlowlorisBig; Undersampling","Springer"

The presented method consists of two approaches, one for reducing a given training set, and another for partitioning the selected/reduced set. The heuristic targets large datasets, since the primary goal is a significant reduction in training computation run-time without compromising prediction accuracy.

We propose a method that works in three stages. First, the ExtraTrees classifier is used to select relevant features for each type of attack individually for each (ELM). Then, an ensemble of ELMs is used to detect each type of attack separately. Finally, the results of all ELMs are combined using a softmax layer to refine the results and increase the accuracy further. The intuition behind our system is that multi-class classification is quite difficult compared to binary classification. So, we divide the multi-class problem into multiple binary classifications. We test our method on the UNSW and KDDcup99 datasets. The results clearly show that our proposed method is able to outperform all the other methods, with a high margin.

Aiming at solving these problems, a similarity metric method based on Siamese network is proposed for detecting defects of button and applied in a practical machine-vision-based system. In our system, the Siamese network with a specifically designed loss function is used for automatic feature extraction and similarity metric of samples. The learning process minimizes the specific loss function, which drives intra-class distance among positives to be smaller and inter-class distance to be larger in the feature space, so that after training, defect-free samples are clustered while defect samples are mapped to outliers. The proposed method is evaluated on button datasets of multiple kinds of defects including dent, crack, stain, hole, uneven etc. Experimental results show 98% detection precision for the proposed method, and 95% detection precision when dealing with imbalance issue, indicating its advantage over conventional methods.

An imbalanced learning model is proposed in this paper to improve the identification of seizure events in long-term EEG signals. To better represent the underlying microstructure distributions of EEG signals while preserving the non-stationary nature, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and uniform 1D-LBP feature extraction procedure are introduced. A learning framework is then designed by the ensemble of weakly trained support vector machines (SVMs). Under-sampling is employed to split the imbalanced seizure and non-seizure samples into multiple balanced subsets where each of them is utilized to train an individual SVM classifier. The weak SVMs are incorporated to build a strong classifier which emphasizes seizure samples and in the meantime analyzing the imbalanced class distribution of EEG data. Final seizure detection results are obtained in a multi-level decision fusion process by considering temporal and frequency factors. The model was validated over two long-term and one short-term public EEG databases. The model achieved a G-mean of 97.14% with respect to epoch-level assessment, an event-level sensitivity of 96.67%, and a false detection rate of 0.86/h on the long-term intracranial database. An epoch-level G-mean of 95.28% and event-level false detection rate of 0.81/h were yielded over the long-term scalp database. The comparisons with 14 published methods demonstrated the improved detection performance for imbalanced EEG signals and the generalizability of the proposed model. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","EasyEnsemble learning; imbalanced classification; local binary pattern; Seizure detection; textural feature","World Scientific Publishing Co.

Currently, methods of treating diabetes are inadequate and costly so prevention becomes an important step in reducing the burden of diabetes and its complications. Electronic health records (EHRs) for each individual or a population have become important tools in understanding developing trends of diseases. Using EHRs to predict the onset of diabetes could improve the quality and efficiency of medical care. In this paper, we apply a wide and deep learning model that combines the strength of a generalised linear model with various features and a deep feed-forward neural network to improve the prediction of the onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Materials and methods: The proposed method was implemented by training various models into a logistic loss function using a stochastic gradient descent. We applied this model using public hospital record data provided by the Practice Fusion EHRs for the United States population. The dataset consists of de-identified electronic health records for 9948 patients, of which 1904 have been diagnosed with T2DM. Prediction of diabetes in 2012 was based on data obtained from previous years (2009–2011). The imbalance class of the model was handled by Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for each cross-validation training fold to analyse the performance when synthetic examples for the minority class are created. We used SMOTE of 150 and 300 percent, in which 300 percent means that three new synthetic instances are created for each minority class instance. This results in the approximated diabetes:non-diabetes distributions in the training set of 1:2 and 1:1, respectively. Results: Our final ensemble model not using SMOTE obtained an accuracy of 84.28%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 84.13%, sensitivity of 31.17% and specificity of 96.85%.

In this work, an efficient and accurate inspection solution based on deep learning was proposed aiming at the detection of codes on complex backgrounds for the plastic container such as beverage packages. Firstly, image processing algorithms such as the region translation method, morphological processing, and image matching technology based on SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) features were implemented to generate synthetic defective samples, which moderated the class-imbalance problem. Data augmentation strategies were used to increase the amount of training data. Secondly, the ShuffleNet V2 framework was adapted to inspect inkjet codes on complex backgrounds. Additionally, the transfer learning was used to transfer the trained model to other inspection tasks for different kinds of packages. Finally, the proposed approach was built onto an in-line code inspection apparatus for the plastic container industry, and an accuracy of 0.9988 was achieved. The in-line testing results of false detection and omission detection rates demonstrated that the proposed solution can fully meet the production requirements.

It has attracted increasing research interest in pattern recognition and machine learning. Traditionally, person re-ID is formulated as a metric learning problem with binary classification output. However, higher order relationship, such as triplet closeness among the instances, is ignored by such pair-wise based metric learning methods. Thus, the discriminative information hidden in these data is insufficiently explored. This paper proposes a new structured loss function to push the frontier of the person re-ID performance in realistic scenarios. The new loss function introduces two margin parameters. They operate as bounds to remove positive pairs of very small distances and negative pairs of large distances. A trade-off coefficient is assigned to the loss term of negative pairs to alleviate class-imbalance problem. By using a linear function with the margin-based objectives, the gradients w.r.t. weight matrices are no longer dependent on the iterative loss values in a multiplicative manner. This makes the weights update process robust to large iterative loss values. The new loss function is compatible with many deep learning architectures, thus, it induces new deep network with pair-pruning regularization for metric learning. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, extensive experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets. The results indicate that the new loss together with the ResNet-50 backbone has excellent feature representation ability for person re-ID. © 2019","Deep neural networks; Feature extraction; Imbalance regularization; Metric learning; Person re-identification","Elsevier Ltd"

This bias, for cases where the minority (positive) class is of greater interest and the occurrence of false negatives is costlier than false positives, may result in adverse consequences. Our paper presents two case studies, each utilizing a unique, combined approach of Random Undersampling and Feature Selection to investigate the effect of class imbalance on big data analytics. Random Undersampling is used to generate six class distributions ranging from balanced to moderately imbalanced, and Feature Importance is used as our Feature Selection method. Classification performance was reported for the Random Forest, Gradient-Boosted Trees, and Logistic Regression learners, as implemented within the Apache Spark framework. The first case study utilized a training dataset and a test dataset from the ECBDL’14 bioinformatics competition. The training and test datasets contain about 32 million instances and 2.9 million instances, respectively. For the first case study, Gradient-Boosted Trees obtained the best results, with either a features-set of 60 or the full set, and a negative-to-positive ratio of either 45:55 or 40:60. The second case study, unlike the first, included training data from one source (POST dataset) and test data from a separate source (Slowloris dataset), where POST and Slowloris are two types of Denial of Service attacks. The POST dataset contains about 1.7 million instances, while the Slowloris dataset contains about 0.2 million instances. For the second case study, Logistic Regression obtained the best results, with a features-set of 5 and any of the following negative-to-positive ratios: 40:60, 45:55, 50:50, 65:35, and 75:25. We conclude that combining Feature Selection with Random Undersampling improves the classification performance of learners with imbalanced big data from different application domains. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big data; Class Imbalance; ECBDL’14; Feature Importance; Feature Selection; Machine Learning; POST; Random Undersampling; Slowloris","SpringerOpen"

Attackers are consistently shifting to stealthier and more complex forms of attacks in an attempt to bypass known mitigation strategies. In recent years, attackers have begun to focus their attack efforts on the application layer, allowing them to produce attacks that can exploit known issues within specific application protocols. Slow HTTP Denial of Service attacks are one such attack variant, which targets the HTTP protocol and can imitate legitimate user traffic in order to deny resources from a service. Successful mitigation of this attack type requires network analysts to evaluate large quantities of network traffic to identify and block intrusive traffic. The issue, is that the number of legitimate traffic instances can far outnumber the amount of attack instances, making detection problematic. Machine learning techniques can be used to aid in detection, but the large level of imbalance between normal (majority) and attack (minority) instances can lead to inaccurate detection results. In this work, we evaluate the use of data sampling to produce varying class distributions in order to counteract the effects of severely imbalanced Slow HTTP DoS big datasets. We also detail our process for collecting real-world representative Slow HTTP DoS attack traffic from a live network environment to create our datasets. Five class distributions are generated to evaluate the Slow HTTP DoS detection performance of eight machine learning techniques. Our results show that the optimal learner and class distribution combination is that of Random Forest with a 65:35 distribution ratio, obtaining an AUC value of 0.99904.

Medicare is a Federal Government healthcare program that provides affordable health insurance to the elderly population and individuals with select disabilities. Unfortunately, there is a significant amount of fraud, waste, and abuse within the Medicare system that costs taxpayers billions of dollars and puts beneficiaries’ health and welfare at risk. Previous work has shown that publicly available Medicare claims data can be leveraged to construct machine learning models capable of automating fraud detection, but challenges associated with class-imbalanced big data hinder performance. With a minority class size of 0.03% and an opportunity to improve existing results, we use the Medicare fraud detection task to compare six deep learning methods designed to address the class imbalance problem. Data-level techniques used in this study include random over-sampling (ROS), random under-sampling (RUS), and a hybrid ROS–RUS. The algorithm-level techniques evaluated include a cost-sensitive loss function, the Focal Loss, and the Mean False Error Loss. A range of class ratios are tested by varying sample rates and desirable class-wise performance is achieved by identifying optimal decision thresholds for each model. Neural networks are evaluated on a 20% holdout test set, and results are reported using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results show that ROS and ROS–RUS perform significantly better than baseline and algorithm-level methods with average AUC scores of 0.8505 and 0.8509, while ROS–RUS maximizes efficiency with a 4× speedup in training time. Plain RUS outperforms baseline methods with up to 30× improvements in training time, and all algorithm-level methods are found to produce more stable decision boundaries than baseline methods. Thresholding results suggest that the decision threshold always be optimized using a validation set, as we observe a strong linear relationship between the minority class size and the optimal threshold. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare multiple data-level and algorithm-level deep learning methods across a range of class distributions. Additional contributions include a unique analysis of the relationship between minority class size and optimal decision threshold and state-of-the-art performance on the given Medicare fraud detection task. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big data; Class imbalance; CMS; Deep learning; Fraud detection; LEIE; Medicare; Thresholding","SpringerOpen"

Effective classification with imbalanced data is an important area of research, as high class imbalance is naturally inherent in many real-world applications, e.g., fraud detection and cancer detection. Moreover, highly imbalanced data poses added difficulty, as most learners will exhibit bias towards the majority class, and in extreme cases, may ignore the minority class altogether. Class imbalance has been studied thoroughly over the last two decades using traditional machine learning models, i.e. non-deep learning. Despite recent advances in deep learning, along with its increasing popularity, very little empirical work in the area of deep learning with class imbalance exists. Having achieved record-breaking performance results in several complex domains, investigating the use of deep neural networks for problems containing high levels of class imbalance is of great interest. Available studies regarding class imbalance and deep learning are surveyed in order to better understand the efficacy of deep learning when applied to class imbalanced data. This survey discusses the implementation details and experimental results for each study, and offers additional insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Several areas of focus include: data complexity, architectures tested, performance interpretation, ease of use, big data application, and generalization to other domains. We have found that research in this area is very limited, that most existing work focuses on computer vision tasks with convolutional neural networks, and that the effects of big data are rarely considered. Several traditional methods for class imbalance, e.g. data sampling and cost-sensitive learning, prove to be applicable in deep learning, while more advanced methods that exploit neural network feature learning abilities show promising results. The survey concludes with a discussion that highlights various gaps in deep learning from class imbalanced data for the purpose of guiding future research. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big data; Class imbalance; Deep learning; Deep neural networks","SpringerOpen"

This makes healthcare fraud difficult to detect, especially when there are considerably less fraudulent transactions (documented and readily available) than non-fraudulent. The ability to successfully detect fraudulent activities in healthcare, given such discrepancies, can garner up to $350 billion in recovered monetary losses. In machine learning, when one class has a substantially larger number of instances (majority) compared to the other (minority), this is known as class imbalance. In this paper, we focus specifically on Medicare, utilizing three ‘Big Data’ Medicare claims datasets with real-world fraudulent physicians. We create a training and test dataset for all three Medicare parts, both separately and combined, to assess fraud detection performance. To emulate class rarity, which indicates particularly severe levels of class imbalance, we generate additional datasets, by removing fraud instances, to determine the effects of rarity on fraud detection performance. Before a machine learning model can be distributed for real-world use, a performance evaluation is necessary to determine the best configuration (e.g. learner, class sampling ratio) and whether the associated error rates are low, indicating good detection rates. With our research, we demonstrate the effects of severe class imbalance and rarity using a training and testing (Train_Test) evaluation method via a hold-out set, and provide our recommendations based on the supervised machine learning results. Additionally, we repeat the same experiments using Cross-Validation, and determine it is a viable substitute for Medicare fraud detection. For machine learning with the severe class imbalance datasets, we found that, as expected, fraud detection performance decreased as the fraudulent instances became more rare. We apply Random Undersampling to both Train_Test and Cross-Validation, for all original and generated datasets, in order to assess potential improvements in fraud detection by reducing the adverse effects of class imbalance and rarity. Overall, our results indicate that the Train_Test method significantly outperforms Cross-Validation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Big Data; Class imbalance; Cross-Validation; Fraud detection; LEIE; Medicare; Random Undersampling; Rarity; Test set","SpringerOpen"

In our proposed algorithms, a K-nearest neighbors-based probability density estimation (KNN-PDE) alike strategy is utilized to calculate the relative density of each training instance. In particular, the relative density is irrelevant with the dimensionality of data distribution in feature space, but only reflects the significance of each instance within its class; hence, it is more robust than the absolute distance information. In addition, the relative density can better seize the prior data distribution information, no matter the data distribution is easy or complex. Even for the data with small injunctions or a large class overlap, the relative density information can reflect its details well.

This yields 27 × 7 × 7 × 17 = 22491 results. The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is used as an unbiased performance measure (unlike the more widely used F1 and AUC measures). Results: (a) we found a large majority (87 percent) of 106 public domain data sets exhibit moderate or low level of imbalance (imbalance ratio <<10; median = 3.94); (b) anything other than low levels of imbalance clearly harm the performance of traditional learning for SDP; (c) imbalanced learning is more effective on the data sets with moderate or higher imbalance, however negative results are always possible; (d) type of classifier has most impact on the improvement in classification performance followed by the imbalanced learning method itself. Type of input metrics is not influential. (e) only \sim 52\%∼52% of the combinations of Imbalanced Learner and Classifier have a significant positive effect. Conclusion: This paper offers two practical guidelines. First, imbalanced learning should only be considered for moderate or highly imbalanced SDP data sets. Second, the appropriate combination of imbalanced method and classifier needs to be carefully chosen to ameliorate the imbalanced learning problem for SDP. In contrast, the indiscriminate application of imbalanced learning can be harmful. © 1976-2012 IEEE.","bug prediction; effect size; imbalance ratio; imbalanced learning; Software defect prediction","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Materials and Methods: A CNN with word embedding was applied to identify 10 incident types and 4 severity levels. Model training and validation used data sets (n-type = 2860, n-severity = 1160) collected from a statewide incident reporting system. Generalizability was evaluated using an independent hospital-level reporting system. CNN architectures were examined by varying layer size and hyperparameters. Performance was evaluated by F score, precision, recall, and compared to binary support vector machine (SVM) ensembles on 3 testing data sets (type/severity: n-benchmark = 286/116, n-original = 444/4837, n-independent = 6000/5950). Results: A CNN with 6 layers was the most effective architecture, outperforming SVMs with better generalizability to identify incidents by type and severity. The CNN achieved high F scores (> 85%) across all test data sets when identifying common incident types including falls, medications, pressure injury, and aggression. When identifying common severity levels (medium/low), CNN outperformed SVMs, improving F scores by 11.9%-45.1% across all 3 test data sets. Discussion: Automated identification of incident reports using machine learning is challenging because of a lack of large labelled training data sets and the unbalanced distribution of incident classes. The standard classification strategy is to build multiple binary classifiers and pool their predictions. CNNs can extract hierarchical features and assist in addressing class imbalance, which may explain their success in identifying incident report types. Conclusion: A CNN with word embedding was effective in identifying incidents by type and severity, providing better generalizability than SVMs. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

However, credit risk remains inevitable. A key challenge is creating a default prediction model that can effectively and accurately predict the default probability of each loan for a P2P lending platform. Due to the characteristics of P2P lending credit data, such as high dimension and class imbalance, conventional statistical models and machine learning algorithms cannot effectively and accurately predict default probability. To address this issue, a decision tree model-based heterogeneous ensemble default prediction model is proposed in this paper for accurate prediction of customer default in P2P lending. Gradient boosting decision trees (GBDT), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) are employed as individual classifiers to create a heterogeneous ensemble learning-based default prediction model. Learning model-based feature ranking is applied to P2P lending credit data, and individual classifiers undergo hyperparameter optimization. Finally, comparison with benchmark models shows that the prediction model can achieve desirable prediction results and thus effectively solve the challenge of predictions based on high-dimensional and imbalanced data. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Default prediction; High-dimensional data; Imbalanced data; Machine learning; P2P lending","Elsevier B.V."

These methods are inclined to accurately classify the majority samples, whereas the minority ones are often misclassified. Oversampling techniques are commonly used in the literature to address this problem. In a complex data environment, most of the oversampling techniques may fail to identify useful original minority instances for oversampling. The consequence is that needless synthetic samples may be generated to obstruct the class boundary and aggravate the leaning task. To handle this issue, a novel method, called Evaluation-Based Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (EBSMOTE), is offered to handle the imbalanced data problem by following five key steps: 1) synthetic instances are created based on SMOTE; 2) synthetic instances are sorted as good or bad based on the estimated rate of variance between the synthetic and the original minority and majority samples; 3) the best synthetic instances are selected based on the good ones; 4) a criterion is defined to reject the synthetic instances that are more likely to be noisy; 5) new synthetic instances are created based on the good ones using SMOTE algorithm and the best set of synthetic instances obtained are added to constitute the balanced training data. The approach is extensively evaluated on several real-world datasets at different imbalance ratio. The C4.5 and Logistic Regression (LR) classifiers are employed for experimental validation. The empirical results show that the proposed method is superior to the compared ones. © 2019 IEEE.","Class Imbalanced; Classification; Machine Learning; SMOTE","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

As such the drug discovery process entails significant challenges as it is time consuming, data intensive, and involves an expensive developmental process which demands rigorous lab testing with high rates of uncertainty that the given drug will succeed. Therefore, it highlights the crucial need for machine learning methods to automate and hasten the drug discovery pipeline for improved healthcare and assist clinicians to make informed decisions for in-vitro testing.

Although this research field has received a lot of attention during the past decade, very few approaches have focused on learning a metric in an imbalanced scenario where the number of positive examples is much smaller than the negatives. Here, we address this challenging task by designing a new Mahalanobis metric learning algorithm (IML) which deals with class imbalance.

This paper explores different methods for imbalanced classification which is a supervised learning problem in which one class is larger than the other. This problem occurs often in binary classification problems than multi-level classification problems. An imbalanced classification problem is in which the dependent variable does not have a balanced proportion of classes.

The previous researches mainly focus on the quality problems of class imbalance and feature redundancy. However, training data often contains some instances that belong to different class but have similar values on features, and this leads to class overlap to affect the quality of training data. Our goal is to investigate the impact of class overlap on software defect prediction. At the same time, we propose an improved K-Means clustering cleaning approach (IKMCCA) to solve both the class overlap and class imbalance problems. Specifically, we check whether K-Means clustering cleaning approach (KMCCA) or neighborhood cleaning learning (NCL) or IKMCCA is feasible to improve defect detection performance for two cases (i) within-project defect prediction (WPDP) (ii) cross-project defect prediction (CPDP). To have an objective estimate of class overlap, we carry out our investigations on 28 open source projects, and compare the performance of state-of-the-art learning models for the above-mentioned cases by using IKMCCA or KMCCA or NCL VS. without cleaning data. The experimental results make clear that learning models obtain significantly better performance in terms of balance, Recall and AUC for both WPDP and CPDP when the overlapping instances are removed.

The main issue is how to capture the fundamental characteristics of the imbalanced data distribution. In particular, whether the hidden pattern can be truly mined from minority class is still a largely unanswered question after all it contains limited instances. The existing methods provide only a partial understanding of this issue and result in the biased and inaccurate classifiers. To overcome this issue, we propose a novel imbalanced classification framework with two stages. The first stage aims to accurately determine the class distributions by a supervised class distribution learning method under the Wasserstein auto-encoder framework. The second stage makes use of the generative adversarial networks to simultaneously generate instances according to the learnt class distributions and mine the discriminative structure among classes to train the final classifier. This proposed framework focuses on Supervised Class Distribution Learning for Generative Adversarial Networks-based imbalanced classification (SCDL-GAN).

The ideal solution to this concern is to prevent in advance by controlling related metabolic factors. However, it is difficult for medical staff to decide whether special precautions are needed for a potential patient only based on the monitoring of physiological indicators unless they are obviously abnormal. This paper will develop a hybrid machine learning approach to predict cerebral stroke for clinical diagnosis based on the physiological data with incompleteness and class imbalance. Methods: Two steps are involved in the whole process. Firstly, random forest regression is adopted to impute missing values before classification. Secondly, an automated hyperparameter optimization(AutoHPO) based on deep neural network(DNN) is applied to stroke prediction on an imbalanced dataset. Results: The medical dataset contains 43,400 records of potential patients which includes 783 occurrences of stroke. The false negative rate from our prediction approach is only 19.1%, which has reduced by an average of 51.5% in comparison to other traditional approaches. The false positive rate, accuracy and sensitivity predicted by the proposed approach are respectively 33.1, 71.6, and 67.4%. Conclusion: The approach proposed in this paper has effectively reduced the false negative rate with a relatively high overall accuracy, which means a successful decrease in the misdiagnosis rate for stroke prediction. The results are more reliable and valid as the reference in stroke prognosis, and also can be acquired conveniently at a low cost. © 2019","AutoHPO; Class imbalance; Clinical decision; Hybrid machine learning; Stroke prediction","Elsevier B.V."

Following technological progress, studies on the behavioral classification of ruminants combining measurements based on accelerometers, magnetometers, and gyroscopes have received attention. However, while the issue of class imbalance has recently become a serious challenge in classification by machine learning, few behavioral classification studies on livestock animals have focused on the effect of equalizing the prevalence of each behavior to improve the problem caused by the imbalance of data on classification performance. The aims of this study were to classify the behaviors of goats using a back-mounted 9-axis multi sensor (a tri-axial accelerometer, a tri-axial gyroscope, and a tri-axial magnetometer) with machine learning algorithms, and to evaluate changes in the predictive scores by equalizing the prevalence of each behavior. The behaviors of three goats grazing on an experimental pasture were logged for approximately 12 h with the multi sensors. The behaviors were recorded at 1-second intervals with time-lapse cameras throughout the experimental period. Three behaviors were classified: lying, standing, and grazing. Over 100 different variables were extracted from the raw sensor data, and classification was executed by inputting the variables into two supervised machine learning algorithms: K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and decision tree (DT). Moreover, because the prevalence of standing was low compared to that of grazing, the number of observations of each behavior in the training datasets for classification models was equalized by undersampling. As expected, the results indicated that the overall accuracies of both algorithms using all variables derived from the three sensors were higher than those using only variables from the acceleration data. Furthermore, both the algorithms using the variables from the acceleration and magnetism data could classify the behaviors as accurate as the algorithms using variables from all sensor data. Balancing the prevalence of each behavior resulted in a decrease in the F1 scores of the lying and grazing classifications but a slight increase in those of the standing classification by DT. In conclusion, our results suggest that, in addition to tri-axial acceleration, tri-axial magnetism is useful for classifying lying, standing, and grazing activities of ruminants and that equalizing the number of data for each behavior is important to correctly assess the predictive accuracy of behavioral classifications, particularly for the behavior with low prevalence. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","9-axis multi sensor; Balancing datasets; Behavioral classification; Goat; Machine learning","Elsevier B.V."

While rare and infrequent crops occupy a small share of the cropped area, they produce ecological benefits on farmland, contribute to sustainability and help provide food and nutritional security. However, data about their location and extent derived from satellite imagery generally lack accuracy, largely owing to the class imbalance problem. Class imbalance occurs when only few instances of some classes are available for training classifiers, and leads to large error rates of the infrequent classes. In this study, we assessed the magnitude of the class imbalance problem in crop classification and evaluated balancing methods to combat it by creating synthetic minority observations or by removing majority observations. To that aim, we generated 18 unbalanced data sets from Sentinel-2 time series and crop type observations in Victoria, Australia. These data sets covered a wide range of complexity, number of classes, number of samples per class and spectral separability which enabled us to gather evidence about the benefits and drawbacks of balancing methods in various settings. Classification accuracy was assessed with two metrics: the Overall Accuracy (OA), which gives more weight to majority classes, and the G-Mean accuracy (GM), which is more sensitive to minority classes. Results showed that class imbalance explained near 40% of the accuracy variability. We found that balancing methods boosted GM by 0.01–0.54 but no single best solution emerged. The price for increasing the accuracy of minority classes was a drop in OA of a magnitude that was problem- and method-specific. We thus applied an algorithm selection method called the F-race to identify optimal balancing methods in a computationally economic fashion. Optimal balancing methods lead to maximum gain in GM and minimum loss in OA. We demonstrated that this approach either successfully identified optimal balancing methods or ones that were not significantly sub-optimal, while reducing the computational cost by up to 60%. It can readily be incorporated to operational crop classification systems with little disruption to the existing processing chains. This contribution paves the way for achieving a more comprehensive and detailed view of crop distribution and cropping sequences. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Classification; Crop mapping; Imbalance learning; Machine learning; Sentinel-2","Elsevier Inc."

The samples with larger and smaller class proportions are called majority and minority class respectively. Weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) was designed to handle the class imbalance problem. Several works such as boosting WELM (BWELM) and ensemble WELM extended WELM by using the ensemble method. All these variant use WELM with the sigmoid node to handle the class imbalance problem effectively. WELM with the sigmoid node suffers from the problem of performance fluctuation due to the random initialization of the weights between the input and the hidden layer. Hybrid artificial bee colony optimization-based WELM extends WELM by finding the optimal weights between the input and the hidden layer by using artificial bee colony optimization algorithm. The computational cost of the kernelized ELM is directly proportional to the number of kernel functions. So, this work proposes a novel ensemble using reduced kernelized WELM as the base classifier to solve the class imbalance problem more effectively. The proposed work uses random undersampling to design balanced training subsets, which act as the centroid of the reduced kernelized WELM classifier. The proposed ensemble generates the base classifier in a sequential manner. The majority class samples misclassified by the first base classifier along with all of the minority class samples act as the centroids of the second base classifier i.e. the base classifiers differ in the choice of the centroids for the kernel functions. The proposed work also has lower computational cost compared to BWELM. The proposed method is evaluated by utilizing the benchmark real-world imbalanced datasets taken from the KEEL dataset repository. The proposed method was also tested on binary synthetic datasets in order to analyze its robustness. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the other state-of-the-art methods for the class imbalance learning. This is also revealed by the statistical tests conducted. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Classification; Imbalance problem; Random undersampling; Reduced kernelized extreme learning machine","Springer Verlag"

Typically, the industrial users are active in day time and inactive in evening while the residential customers are expected to have quite opposite behavior. This disparity will create an imbalance of traffic load on the wavelengths of TWDM PON. Like IEEE PONs, a load proportional wavelength activation approach cannot work for ITU compliant PONs as ITU standard requires all the wavelengths to be active simultaneously. Moreover, the ONUs cannot be assigned bandwidth on two different wavelengths simultaneously and the migration of an ONU from one wavelength to another causes a tuning delay due to a handshaking mechanism between the OLT and the ONU. Therefore, this work proposes an efficient load balancing dynamic wavelength and bandwidth assignment (LB-DWBA) scheme for TWDM PON to maintain a balanced load between the heavily loaded and least loaded ONUs using a regression based machine learning approach. Simulation results show that LB-DWBA scheme not only reduces the traffic load of heavily loaded wavelengths but also minimizes the bandwidth waste from the excess assigned bandwidth assigned to ONUs using type-5 (T5) traffic class. Overall, the LB-DWBA scheme reduces the average upstream delays of type-2 (T2), type-3 (T3) and type-4 (T4) by 18.9%, 24% and 43% respectively. © 2019","DBA; DWBA; Dynamic bandwidth assignment; Dynamic wavelength assignment; PON; TWDM PON","Academic Press Inc."

Most existing SDP methods are performed under a within-project setting. However, there usually is little to no within-project training data to learn an available supervised prediction model for a new SDP task. Therefore, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP), which uses labeled data of source projects to learn a defect predictor for a target project, was proposed as a practical SDP solution. In real CPDP tasks, the class imbalance problem is ubiquitous and has a great impact on performance of the CPDP models. Unlike previous studies that focus on subsampling and individual methods, this study investigated 15 imbalanced learning methods for CPDP tasks, especially for assessing the effectiveness of imbalanced ensemble learning (IEL) methods. We evaluated the 15 methods by extensive experiments on 31 open-source projects derived from five datasets. Through analyzing a total of 37504 results, we found that in most cases, the IEL method that combined under-sampling and bagging approaches will be more effective than the other investigated methods. © 2019 World Scientific Publishing Company.","cross-project defect prediction; ensemble learning; imbalanced learning; Intelligent software engineering","World Scientific Publishing Co.

However, this hypothesis is not always true in real-world applications, and hence, there is a tendency of relying on the classification models that are biased towards the overrepresented class as traditional data mining algorithms are generally inclined towards building of suboptimal classification models. This class imbalance problem is common to many application domains such as data mining, machine learning, pattern recognition, etc. Several techniques have been proposed to alleviate the problem of class imbalance. RUSBoost is one of the ensemble learning approaches that uses random undersampling (RUS) for data resampling and AdaBoost technique for boosting, as a solution to class imbalance. However, RUS may cause the loss of significant information of dataset. Therefore, this paper proposes Tomek-link undersampling-based boosting (TLUSBoost) algorithm which uses Tomek-linked and redundancy-based undersampling (TLRUS) for data resampling and AdaBoost technique for boosting. TLRUS meticulously finds outliers using Tomek-link concept and then eliminates some of the probable redundant instances from the outliers. Hence, this algorithm reduces the loss of information and conserves the characteristics of the dataset, thereby helping the classifier to be trained appropriately. TLUSBoost method is validated with 16 benchmark datasets and compared with EasyEnsemble, BalanceCascade, SMOTEBoost and RUSBoost algorithms. Ten-fold cross-validation is applied to measure overall accuracy and F-measure metric of the models. Experimental results show that the proposed model is better than EasyEnsemble, BalanceCascade, SMOTEBoost and RUSBoost in both overall accuracy and F-measure performance metric. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Boosting; Class imbalance problem; Data mining; Tomek-link pair; Undersampling","Springer Verlag"

In various classification problems, the main interest is to correctly classify the samples belonging to the minority class. Since support vector machine (SVM) and twin support vector machine (TWSVM) obtain the resultant classifier by giving same importance to all the training samples, it results in a biased classifier towards the majority class in imbalanced datasets. In this paper, by considering the fuzzy membership value for each sample, we have proposed an efficient approach, entropy-based fuzzy twin support vector machine for class imbalanced datasets (EFTWSVM-CIL) where fuzzy membership values are assigned based on the entropy values of samples. Here, we give more importance to the minority class by assigning relatively larger fuzzy memberships to the minority class samples. Further, it solves a pair of smaller-size quadratic programming problems (QPPs) rather than a large one as in the case of SVM.

Similar to other information systems, a significant threat to industrial control systems is the attack from cyberspace—the offensive maneuvers launched by “anonymous” in the digital world that target computer-based assets with the goal of compromising a system's functions or probing for information. Owing to the importance of industrial control systems, and the possibly devastating consequences of being attacked, significant endeavors have been attempted to secure industrial control systems from cyberattacks. Among them are intrusion detection systems that serve as the first line of defense by monitoring and reporting potentially malicious activities. Classical machine-learning-based intrusion detection methods usually generate prediction models by learning modest-sized training samples all at once. Such approach is not always applicable to industrial control systems, as industrial control systems must process continuous control commands with limited computational resources in a nonstop way. To satisfy such requirements, we propose using online learning to learn prediction models from the controlling data stream. We introduce several state-of-the-art online learning algorithms categorically, and illustrate their efficacies on two typically used testbeds—power system and gas pipeline. Further, we explore a new cost-sensitive online learning algorithm to solve the class-imbalance problem that is pervasive in industrial intrusion detection systems. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can achieve an overall improvement in the detection rate of cyberattacks in industrial control systems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cost-sensitive learning; Cybersecurity; Industrial control systems; Intrusion detection; Online learning","Elsevier B.V."

Data and feature sampling are two popular methods of increasing such diversity. This is exemplified by Random Forests (RFs), known as a very effective classifier. However real-world data remain challenging due to several issues, such as multi-class imbalance, data redundancy, and class noise. Ensemble margin theory is a proven effective way to improve the performance of classification models. It can be used to detect the most important instances and thus help ensemble classifiers to avoid the negative effects of the class noise and class imbalance. To obtain accurate classification results, this paper proposes the Ensemble-Margin Based Random Forests (EMRFs) method, which combines RFs and a new subsampling iterative technique making use of computed ensemble margin values. As for comparative analysis, the learning techniques considered are: SVM, AdaBoost, RFs and the Subsample based Random Forests (SubRFs).

They function mainly as translational repressors in mammals. Therefore, how to identify miRNAs is one of the most important problems in medical treatment. Many known pre-miRNAs have a hairpin ring structure containing more structural features, and it is difficult to identify mature miRNAs because of their short length. Therefore, most research focuses on the identification of pre-miRNAs. Most computational models rely on manual feature extraction to identify pre-miRNAs and do not consider the sequential and spatial characteristics of pre-miRNAs, resulting in a loss of information. As the number of unidentified pre-miRNAs is far greater than that of known pre-miRNAs, there is a dataset imbalance problem, which leads to a degradation of the performance of pre-miRNA identification methods. In order to overcome the limitations of existing methods, we propose a pre-miRNA identification algorithm based on a cascaded CNN-LSTM framework, called CL-PMI. We used a convolutional neural network to automatically extract features and obtain pre-miRNA spatial information. We also employed long short-term memory (LSTM) to capture time characteristics of pre-miRNAs and improve attention mechanisms for long-term dependence modeling. Focal loss was used to improve the dataset imbalance. Compared with existing methods, CL-PMI achieved better performance on all datasets. The results demonstrate that this method can effectively identify pre-miRNAs by simultaneously considering their spatial and sequential information, as well as dealing with imbalance in the datasets. © Copyright © 2019 Wang, Ma, Dong, Li, Wang and Liu.","convolutional neural network; deep learning; imbalanced learning; long short-term memory network; pre-miRNA identification","Frontiers Media S.A."

An analysis of the problem indicates that it is caused by differing amounts of data in each class and too few features in the minority class data. To address these issues, we propose a generative model that creates sufficient additional minority class data to eliminate the imbalance in the data amounts. This can also resolve the issue of a lack of minority class features. The proposed method is based on a neural network that uses the squared error as its error function, which is easy to calculate. The generated data is combined with the original minority class data, thereby reducing the proportion of generated data used and any effects due to differences between the generated and original data. We also expect that adding generated data will supplement the number of minority class features seen in the original data. Experiments evaluating our proposed method with artificial data show that it yielded a higher AUC value than that of undersampling.

It is strongly associated with major adverse events, which in turn leads to increased cost and poor outcomes (eg, need for nursing home due to cognitive impairment, stroke, and death). The ability to foresee patients at risk of delirium will guide the timely initiation of multimodal preventive interventions, which will aid in reducing the burden and negative consequences associated with delirium. Several studies have focused on the prediction of delirium. However, the number of studies in cardiac surgical patients that have used machine learning methods is very limited. Objective: This study aimed to explore the application of several machine learning predictive models that can pre-emptively predict delirium in patients undergoing cardiac surgery and compare their performance. Methods: We investigated a number of machine learning methods to develop models that can predict delirium after cardiac surgery. A clinical dataset comprising over 5000 actual patients who underwent cardiac surgery in a single center was used to develop the models using logistic regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), Bayesian belief networks (BBN), naïve Bayesian, random forest, and decision trees. Results: Only 507 out of 5584 patients (11.4%) developed delirium. We addressed the underlying class imbalance, using random undersampling, in the training dataset. The final prediction performance was validated on a separate test dataset. Owing to the target class imbalance, several measures were used to evaluate algorithm's performance for the delirium class on the test dataset. Out of the selected algorithms, the SVM algorithm had the best F1 score for positive cases, kappa, and positive predictive value (40.2%, 29.3%, and 29.7%, respectively) with a P=.01, .03, .02, respectively. The ANN had the best receiver-operator area-under the curve (78.2%; P=.03). The BBN had the best precision-recall area-under the curve for detecting positive cases (30.4%; P=.03). Conclusions: Although delirium is inherently complex, preventive measures to mitigate its negative effect can be applied proactively if patients at risk are prospectively identified. Our results highlight 2 important points: (1) addressing class imbalance on the training dataset will augment machine learning model's performance in identifying patients likely to develop postoperative delirium, and (2) as the prediction of postoperative delirium is difficult because it is multifactorial and has complex pathophysiology, applying machine learning methods (complex or simple) may improve the prediction by revealing hidden patterns, which will lead to cost reduction by prevention of complications and will optimize patients' outcomes. © 2019 JMIR Publications Inc..

Previously, we employed machine-learning methods to define and predict pain volatility levels from users of the Manage My Pain app. Reducing the number of features is important to help increase interpretability of such prediction models. Prediction results also need to be consolidated from multiple random subsamples to address the class imbalance issue. Objective: This study aimed to: (1) increase the interpretability of previously developed pain volatility models by identifying the most important features that distinguish high from low volatility users; and (2) consolidate prediction results from models derived from multiple random subsamples while addressing the class imbalance issue. Methods: A total of 132 features were extracted from the first month of app use to develop machine learning–based models for predicting pain volatility at the sixth month of app use. Three feature selection methods were applied to identify features that were significantly better predictors than other members of the large features set used for developing the prediction models: (1) Gini impurity criterion; (2) information gain criterion; and (3) Boruta. We then combined the three groups of important features determined by these algorithms to produce the final list of important features. Three machine learning methods were then employed to conduct prediction experiments using the selected important features: (1) logistic regression with ridge estimators; (2) logistic regression with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator; and (3) random forests. Multiple random under-sampling of the majority class was conducted to address class imbalance in the dataset. Subsequently, a majority voting approach was employed to consolidate prediction results from these multiple subsamples. The total number of users included in this study was 879, with a total number of 391,255 pain records. Results: A threshold of 1.6 was established using clustering methods to differentiate between 2 classes: low volatility (n=694) and high volatility (n=185). The overall prediction accuracy is approximately 70% for both random forests and logistic regression models when using 132 features. Overall, 9 important features were identified using 3 feature selection methods. Of these 9 features, 2 are from the app use category and the other 7 are related to pain statistics. After consolidating models that were developed using random subsamples by majority voting, logistic regression models performed equally well using 132 or 9 features. Random forests performed better than logistic regression methods in predicting the high volatility class. The consolidated accuracy of random forests does not drop significantly (601/879; 68.4% vs 618/879; 70.3%) when only 9 important features are included in the prediction model. Conclusions: We employed feature selection methods to identify important features in predicting future pain volatility. To address class imbalance, we consolidated models that were developed using multiple random subsamples by majority voting. Reducing the number of features did not result in a significant decrease in the consolidated prediction accuracy. ©Quazi Abidur Rahman, Tahir Janmohamed, Hance Clarke, Paul Ritvo, Jane Heffernan, Joel Katz.","Chronic pain; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Machine learning; Manage My Pain; Pain app; Pain volatility; Prediction model","JMIR Publications Inc."

To minimize red tide damage, it is important to anticipate and prepare the red tide occurrence timing and location in advance. In this study, we predicted the occurrence of red tide of <i>C. polykrikoides</i> using machine learning techniques and compared the results of each algorithm. Logistic regression model, decision tree model, and multilayer neural network model were used for prediction of red tide occurrence. To produce the data set for model learning, we used the red tide occurrence map provided by the National Institute of Fisheries Science, the Local Data Assimilation and Prediction System (LDAPS) provided by the Korea Meteorological Agency, and the G1SST provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The feature vectors used for modeling consisted of 59 elements, which were made by using temperature, water temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind direction and wind speed. Only a very small number of red tide cases can be collected compared to the case of no red tide cases. Thus, an imbalance data problem arises in the data set. To overcome this imbalanced data problem, we used adding noise after oversampling to data of red tide occurrence to solve the difference of data between two classes.The data set is divided into 8&thinsp;:&thinsp;2 to prevent over-fitting and 80% is used as the learning data. The remaining 20% was used to evaluate the performance of each model. As a result of evaluating the prediction performance of each model, the multilayer neural network model showed the highest prediction accuracy. © 2019 S. H.

The decision to remove or maintain the chest tube is based on drainage data collected from a digital pump that continuously monitors the patient. We construct a classifier to support this clinical decision-making process by identifying patients who may suffer adverse, extended air leaks early on. Intuitively, this problem can be modelled as a time-series fitted to monitoring data. However, we present a solution using a simple classifier constructed from data collected in a specific time frame (36- 48 hours) after surgery. We hypothesize that after surgery, patients struggle to attain a stable (favourable or adverse) status which prevails after a period of discrepancies and inconsistencies in the data. A solutions, we propose, is to identify this time frame when the majority of patients achieve their states of stability. Advantages of this approach include better classification performance with a lower burden of data collection during patient treatment. The paper presents the chest tube management as a classification task performed in a sliding window over time during patient monitoring. Our results show that reliable predictions can be achieved in the time window we identify, and that our classifier reduces unsafe chest tube removals at the expense of potentially maintaining a few that can be removed, i.e., we ensure that chest tubes that need to be maintained are not removed with potentially maintaining a few unnecessarily. © 2019 IEEE.","Chest Tube; Class Imbalance; Classification; Digital Pleural Drainage; Lung Cancer; Lung Resection; Machine Learning; Thoracic Surgery","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

At the same time it can significantly affect the classification performance of most standard algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks. One of the approaches for dealing with data imbalance is artificially reducing the number of objects from the over-represented class, an approach called undersampling. In this paper we present a novel undersampling technique, Radial-Based Undersampling (RBU), and apply it to the classification of breast cancer histopathological images.

Accordingly, the chi-square test used to filter relevant and significant features, thus the multivariate analysis was used with logistic regression. In essence, age, education, and frequent alcohol use are important predictors in smoking cessation success. Furthermore, the lowest level of subjective health status has increased the likelihood of unsuccessful smoking cessation.In terms of the class imbalance problem, we have employed an efficient Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) in order to generate new synthetic records.

A key problem of one-class support vector machine is the selection of its kernel function and parameters, which has a vital impact on the final performance of the classifier. At present, there is no unified method for how to select the appropriate kernel function and its parameters. In order to solve this problem, the multiple kernel method is introduced into the one-class support vector machine. i.e., a combined kernel is used to replace a single kernel in the one-class support vector machine, where the combined kernel is obtained by weighted summation of several basic kernels, and the kernel weight is calculated by the kernel-target alignment.

In recent years, FAUD has become an attractive task since these slight changes on face reveal some cues of emotions which can then be utilized to infer people's affective. Many prior works are developed based on physical features of AUs, such as regional occurrence and temporal continuity, but few of them concern the negative impact of individual differences, causing an unrobust result in variant subjects and environments. To deal with the problem, a contrastive feature learning method is proposed to make a convolutional neural network (CNN) learn to extract the contrastive feature which is the difference between the features of a neutral face image and an AU-occurred face image. In this way, the individual information will be mitigated so that it becomes easier to detect AUs according to the features. A great disparity between the number of positive and negative samples, named as data imbalance, makes a serious interference in most detection problems, including FAUD. A lower occurrence rate of an AU leads a more severe data imbalance problem, which results in a biased result for the AU detection. Therefore, the class-weighted loss is proposed to change the weight-ratio between the positive and negative samples so as to encourage the learning of the positive samples and ease that of negative samples. Two widely used databases, BP4D and DISFA, are adopted to be the benchmark of the performance testing. In the experiment, it shows that the proposed method performs well both in accuracy and speed comparing with the state-of-the-art approaches. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Seizure prediction is widely recognized as a significant problem in the neuroscience domain. Developing a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for seizure prediction can provide an alert to the patient, providing a buffer time to get the necessary emergency medication or at least be able to call for help, thus improving the quality of life of the patients. A considerable number of clinical studies presented evidence of symptoms (patterns) before seizure episodes and thus, there is large research on seizure prediction, however, there is very little existing literature that illustrates the use of structured processes in machine learning for predicting seizures. Limited training data and class imbalance (EEG segments corresponding to preictal phase, the duration just before the seizure, to about an hour prior to the episode, are usually in a tiny minority) are a few challenges that need to be addressed when employing machine learning for this task. In this paper we present a comparative study of various machine learning approaches that can be used for classification of EEG signals into preictal and interictal (Interictal is the time between seizures) using the features extracted from the intracranial EEG. Publicly available data has been used for this purpose for both human and canine subjects. After data pre-processing and extensive feature extraction, different models are trained and are effectively used to analyze the temporal dynamics of the brain (interictal and preictal) in affected subjects.

The AE-CGAN (autoencoder-conditional GAN) model is proposed to improve the performance of intrusion detection. This model oversamples rare classes based on the GAN model in order to solve the performance degradation caused by data imbalance after processing the characteristics of the data to a lower level using the autoencoder model. To measure the performance of the AE-CGAN model, data is classified using random forest (RF), a typical machine learning classification algorithm. In this experiment, we used the canadian institute for cybersecurity intrusion detection system (CICIDS)2017 dataset, the latest public dataset of network intrusion detection system (NIDS), and compared the three models to confirm efficacy of the proposed model. We compared the performance of three types of models. These included single-RF, a classification model using only a classification algorithm, AE-RF which is processed by classifying data features, and the AE-CGAN model which is classified after solving the data feature processing and data imbalance. Experimental results showed that the performance of the AE-CGAN model proposed in this paper was the highest. In particular, when the data were unbalanced, the performances of recall and F1 score, which are more accurate performance indicators, were 93.29% and 95.38%, respectively.

However, owing to certain complexities found in real-world problems, such as class imbalance, classical learning algorithms may not reach a prescribed performance. There can be situations where a good result on different conflicting objectives is desirable, such as true positive and true negative ratios, or it is important to balance model's complexity and prediction score. To solve such issues, the application of multi-objective optimization design procedures can be used to analyze various trade-offs and build more robust machine learning models. Thus, the creation of ensembles of predictive models using such procedures is addressed in this work. First, a set of diverse predictive models is built by employing a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. Next, a second multi-objective optimization step selects the previous models as ensemble members, resulting on several non-dominated solutions. A final multi-criteria decision making stage is applied to rank and visualize the resulting ensembles. To analyze the proposed methodology, two different experiments are conducted for binary classification. The first case study is a famous classification problem through which the proposed procedure is illustrated. The second one is a challenging real-world problem related to water quality monitoring, where the proposed procedure is compared to four classical ensemble learning algorithms. Results on this second experiment show that the proposed technique is able to create robust ensembles that can outperform other ensemble methods. Overall, the authors conclude that the proposed methodology for ensemble generation creates competitive models for real-world engineering problems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ensemble learning; Multi-criteria decision making; Multi-objective optimization","Elsevier Ltd"

In this article, we discuss the properties of the δ-machine, propose an automatic decision rule for deciding on the number of clusters for the K-means method on the predictive perspective, and derive variable importance measures and partial dependence plots for the machine. We performed five simulation studies to investigate the properties of the δ-machine. The first three simulation studies were conducted to investigate selection of prototypes, different (dis)similarity functions, and the definition of representation set. Results indicate that we best use the Lasso to select prototypes, that the Euclidean distance is a good dissimilarity function, and that finding a small representation set of prototypes gives sparse but competitive results. The remaining two simulation studies investigated the performance of the δ-machine with imbalanced classes and with unequal covariance matrices for the two classes. The results obtained show that the δ-machine is robust to class imbalances, and that the four (dis)similarity functions had the same performance regardless of the covariance matrices. We also showed the classification performance of the δ-machine compared with three other classification methods on ten real datasets from UCI database, and discuss two empirical examples in detail. © 2019, The Author(s).","Dissimilarity space; Nonlinear classification; The Lasso","Springer"

In these studies, dermatologists and artificial intelligence were considered as opponents. However, the combination of classifiers frequently yields superior results, both in machine learning and among humans. In this study, we investigated the potential benefit of combining human and artificial intelligence for skin cancer classification. Methods: Using 11,444 dermoscopic images, which were divided into five diagnostic categories, novel deep learning techniques were used to train a single CNN. Then, both 112 dermatologists of 13 German university hospitals and the trained CNN independently classified a set of 300 biopsy-verified skin lesions into those five classes. Taking into account the certainty of the decisions, the two independently determined diagnoses were combined to a new classifier with the help of a gradient boosting method. The primary end-point of the study was the correct classification of the images into five designated categories, whereas the secondary end-point was the correct classification of lesions as either benign or malignant (binary classification). Findings: Regarding the multiclass task, the combination of man and machine achieved an accuracy of 82.95%. This was 1.36% higher than the best of the two individual classifiers (81.59% achieved by the CNN). Owing to the class imbalance in the binary problem, sensitivity, but not accuracy, was examined and demonstrated to be superior (89%) to the best individual classifier (CNN with 86.1%). The specificity in the combined classifier decreased from 89.2% to 84%. However, at an equal sensitivity of 89%, the CNN achieved a specificity of only 81.5% Interpretation: Our findings indicate that the combination of human and artificial intelligence achieves superior results over the independent results of both of these systems. © 2019 The Author(s)","Artificial intelligence; Deep learning; Melanoma; Skin cancer","Elsevier Ltd"

However, it usually appears as poor predictive performance because the datasets are high-throughput and have a class-imbalance problem. In this study, several strategies of performing a structure-activity relationship study for a cytotoxic endpoint in the AID364 dataset were explored to solve the class-imbalance problem. Random forest adaboost was used as the base learners for 10 types of molecular fingerprints and an ensemble method and six data-balancing methods were applied to balance the classes. As a result, the ensemble model using MACCS fingerprint was found to be the best, giving area under the curve of 85.2% ± 0.35%, sensitivity of 81.8% ± 0.65%, and specificity of 76.0% ± 0.12% in fivefold cross-validation and area under the curve of 78.8%, sensitivity of 55.5% and specificity of 78.5% in external validation. Good performance also appeared on other datasets with different sizes/degrees of imbalance. To explore the structural commonality of cytotoxic compounds, several substructures were identified as an important reference for substructure alerts.

Synthetic over-sampling, as popular class-imbalance learning methods, could introduce much noise when minority class has limited data since the synthetic samples are not i.i.d. samples of minority class. Most sophisticated synthetic sampling methods tackle this problem by denoising or generating samples more consistent with ground-truth data distribution. But their assumptions about true noise or ground-truth data distribution may not hold. To adapt synthetic sampling to the problem of limited minority class data, the proposed Traso framework treats synthetic minority class samples as an additional data source, and exploits transfer learning to transfer knowledge from them to minority class. As an implementation, TrasoBoost method firstly generates synthetic samples to balance class sizes. Then in each boosting iteration, the weights of synthetic samples and original data decrease and increase respectively when being misclassified, and remain unchanged otherwise. The misclassified synthetic samples are potential noise, and thus have smaller influence in the following iterations. Besides, the weights of minority class instances have greater change than those of majority class instances to be more influential. And only original data are used to estimate error rate to be immune from noise. Finally, since the synthetic samples are highly related to minority class, all of the weak learners are aggregated for prediction. Experimental results show TrasoBoost outperforms many popular class-imbalance learning methods. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","boosting; class imbalance; data mining; machine learning; over sampling; transfer learning","Higher Education Press"

It is commonly agreed that traditional classifiers are certainly limited to imbalanced datasets and do not perform well. A number of solutions to the problem were proposed at both data and algorithmic levels. We propose the point-normal form of a plane, namely SVM-rebalancing, to be based on the second type. In this learning process, the assumption of pseudo-prior probabilities provides a rebalanced recipe for countering the imbalance inspired by Bayesian decision theory. Thus, we set a rebalancing programming problem by incorporating a rebalanced heuristics into the fitting of model to raise the class separability. In addition, various measures are used to characterize the performance of classifiers. Compared with several popular decision tree splitting criteria and cost-sensitive learning, the proposed method gives comparable separability with minority class to avoid heavy biasing of the majority class. © 2018, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Cost-sensitive learning; Decision tree; Point-normal form; SVM-rebalancing","Springer London"

The computational prediction of novel miRNAs involves training a classifier for identifying sequences having the highest chance of being precursors of miRNAs (pre-miRNAs). The big issue with this task is that well-known pre-miRNAs are usually few in comparison with the hundreds of thousands of candidate sequences in a genome, which results in high class imbalance. This imbalance has a strong influence on most standard classifiers, and if not properly addressed in the model and the experiments, not only performance reported can be completely unrealistic but also the classifier will not be able to work properly for pre-miRNA prediction. Besides, another important issue is that for most of the machine learning (ML) approaches already used (supervised methods), it is necessary to have both positive and negative examples. The selection of positive examples is straightforward (well-known pre-miRNAs). However, it is difficult to build a representative set of negative examples because they should be sequences with hairpin structure that do not contain a pre-miRNA. Results: This review provides a comprehensive study and comparative assessment of methods from these two ML approaches for dealing with the prediction of novel pre-miRNAs: supervised and unsupervised training. We present and analyze the ML proposals that have appeared during the past 10 years in literature. They have been compared in several prediction tasks involving two model genomes and increasing imbalance levels. This work provides a review of existing ML approaches for pre-miRNA prediction and fair comparisons of the classifiers with same features and data sets, instead of just a revision of published software tools. The results and the discussion can help the community to select the most adequate bioinformatics approach according to the prediction task at hand. The comparative results obtained suggest that from low to mid-imbalance levels between classes, supervised methods can be the best. However, at very high imbalance levels, closer to real case scenarios, models including unsupervised and deep learning can provide better performance. © 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

There is no cure for autism. But the management and treatment of accompanying medical conditions can be done. One of the effects of his medical condition is a sleep disorder. But children with autism have difficulty communicating the disorders they experience. In medicine, the detection of sleep disorders can be done through a test called polysomnography. One of the purposes of this test is to find the patient's sleep patterns through the sleep stage classification. But the doctors need several days to analyze each test. This study proposes an application that can classify it automatically. The method used was based on machine learning. The two classifiers were classification via regression and random committee. The both performances were compared in sleep stages classification for the autism patients. The result showed that random committees had a higher performance than classification via regression. Its performance got more than 85% for accuracy, precision, recall, and F-measure. This study also implemented resampling to overcome imbalance class problems.

In recent years, many related algorithms have been proposed to solve such an issue. Among them, under-sampling is an effective and timesaving data pre-processing method, which balances the dataset by removing some examples from the majority class. However, these proposed under-sampling methods often lose some useful information or ignore noise in the datasets, which will result in the performance degradation. This paper proposes a density-based under-sampling algorithm (DBU) to solve these two problems. In feature space, similar examples are close to each other and noisy example is far from other examples belonging to the same class. Thus the similar examples have a high density while the noisy example has a low density. DBU uses the local density peaks to represent the whole majority class, so that it can retain the useful information and eliminate the noisy examples automatically. To evaluate our algorithm, experiments are conducted on 15 two-class imbalanced datasets. Experimental results show that DBU achieves the better results than other under-sampling methods. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing"

The classification process’s effectiveness relies on the training set’s data. However, when k-NN classifier is applied to a real world, various issues could arise; for instance, they are considered to be computationally expensive as the complete training set needs to be stored in the computer for classification of the unseen data. Also, intolerance of k-NN classifier towards irrelevant features can be seen. Conversely, imbalance in the training data could occur wherein considerably larger numbers of data could be seen with some classes versus other classes. Thus, selected training data are employed to improve the effectiveness of k-NN classifier when dealing with large datasets. In this research work, a substitute method is present to enhance data selection by simultaneously clubbing the feature selection as well as instances selection pertaining to k-NN classifier by employing Cooperative Binary Particle Swarm Optimisation (CBPSO). This method can also address the constraint of employing the k-nearest neighbour classifier, particularly when handling high dimensional and imbalance data. A comparison study was performed to demonstrate the performance of our approach by employing 20 real world datasets taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The corresponding table of the classification rate demonstrates the algorithm’s performance.

There are several ways to deal with cyber trolling, one of which is to implement Support Vector Machine Classifier to separate between cyber troll tweets and normal tweets. Since most of the tweets are normal tweets, it is hard to obtain a balance between them and this leaves us at 1:2 ratio or even more. Just like most machine learning algorithm, SVM can show poor performance on the minority class because SVM was designed to induce a model based on the overall error. In this paper, we tried to implement KNN-Undersampling method before the actual classifying process to deal with imbalanced data and compare them to SVM with SMOTE and normal SVM.

Class imbalance and lack of enough sample images make the process of classifying hyperspectral remote sensing images (RSI) more difficult. One well-known unsupervised learning algorithm called self-organizing maps (SOM) which utilizes competitive learning for training neurons to represent particular subsets of a dataset well. The SOM has been used for classification with RSI but does not generate any outstanding results. In addition, by using the typically small map sizes for SOM, the minority classes are not recognized adequately. To improve SOM, the concept of Emergent SOM (ESOM) was introduced where the use of much larger map sizes of at least four thousand neurons was recommended. To handle the class imbalance in RSI with unsupervised classification, we propose the use of much larger and more massive SOM than suggested. With a more significant number of representable cluster centers, the minority classes can be detected as the projection onto a map size of that magnitude magnifies the input subset resulting in a higher granularity with a deeper level of detail. Our experimental results show that the massive SOM (MSOM) can classify entire hyperspectral images with impressive classification accuracy along with identifying minority classes accurately. Simultaneously, the performance of MSOM rivals current contemporary supervised learning methods. © 2019 IEEE.","Class Imbalance; Emergence SOM; Image Classification; Self-Organizing Map","IEEE Computer Society"

To minimize these losses and reduce forest fires, modeling and predicting the occurrence of forest fires are meaningful because they can support forest fire prevention and management. In recent years, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has become an important state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, and its implementation has enriched many fields. Therefore, we proposed a spatial prediction model for forest fire susceptibility using a CNN. Past forest fire locations in Yunnan Province, China, from 2002 to 2010, and a set of 14 forest fire influencing factors were mapped using a geographic information system. Oversampling was applied to eliminate the class imbalance, and proportional stratified sampling was used to construct the training/validation sample libraries. A CNN architecture that is suitable for the prediction of forest fire susceptibility was designed and hyperparameters were optimized to improve the prediction accuracy. Then, the test dataset was fed into the trained model to construct the spatial prediction map of forest fire susceptibility in Yunnan Province. Finally, the prediction performance of the proposed model was assessed using several statistical measures—Wilcoxon signed-rank test, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve (AUC). The results confirmed the higher accuracy of the proposed CNN model (AUC 0.86) than those of the random forests, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron neural network, and kernel logistic regression benchmark classifiers. The CNN has stronger fitting and classification abilities and can make full use of neighborhood information, which is a promising alternative for the spatial prediction of forest fire susceptibility.

Due to the small sample size, high dimensionality, and class imbalances of cancer gene data, classifying cancer subtypes by traditional machine learning methods remains challenging. The gcForest algorithm is a combination of machine learning methods and a deep neural network and has been indicated to achieve better classification of small samples of data. However, the gcForest algorithm still faces many challenges when this method is applied to the classification of cancer subtypes. In this paper, we propose an improved gcForest algorithm (MLW-gcForest) to study the applicability of this method to the small sample sizes, high dimensionality, and class imbalances of genetic data. The main contributions of this algorithm are as follows: (1) Different weights are assigned to different random forests according to the classification ability of the forests. (2)We propose a sorting optimization algorithm that assigns different weights to the feature vectors generated under different sliding windows. The MLW-gcForest model is trained on the methylation data of five data sets from the cancer genome atlas (TCGA).

The seismic behavior of buildings is strongly affected by the ST, including material, age, height, and other main structural features. Previous works deployed in situ data integrated with remote sensing information to statistically infer STs through supervised ML methods. We propose a transferable methodology with specific focus on situations with imbalanced in situ data (i.e., the number of available labeled samples for model learning differs largely between different STs). We learn a transferable model by selecting features from an exhaustive set. The transferability relies on deploying geometric features characterizing individual buildings; thus, the model is less sensitive to domain adaption problems frequently induced by e.g., changes in acquisition parameters of remotely sensed imagery. Thereby, we show that few geometry features enable generalization capabilities similar to models learned with a large number of features describing spectral, geometrical or contextual building properties. We rely on an extensive geodatabase containing almost 18,000 building footprints. We follow a Random Forest (RF)-based feature selection strategy to objectively identify most valuable features for prediction. Furthermore, the problem of unbalanced classes is addressed by adopting two approaches: downsampling the majority class and modifying the classifier internally (weighted RF). The implemented model is transferred on the challenging urban morphology of the Val d’Agri area (Italy). Results confirm the statistical robustness of the model and the importance of the geometry features, allowing for reliable identification of STs. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Building inventory; Building structural type; Class imbalance; Machine learning; Remote sensing; Seismic vulnerability","Springer Netherlands"

Traditional classification algorithms like extreme learning machine (ELM) and support vector machine (SVM) are biased towards the majority class. They minimize the least squares error due to which the minority class instances are usually misclassified. The classification algorithms like weighted ELM (WELM) and weighted SVM minimize the weighted least squares error to address the class imbalance problem effectively. The variants of WELM like boosting WELM, ensemble WELM etc. further improve the performance of WELM by employing ensemble method. This work proposes class-specific AdaC1, class-specific AdaC2 and class-specific AdaC3 algorithms for addressing the class imbalance problem more effectively. This work employs kernelized WELM as the component classifier to make the proposed ensemble. The proposed classifier ensembles are the variants of AdaC1, AdaC2 and AdaC3 algorithms. The cost-sensitive boosting classifiers AdaC1, AdaC2 and AdaC3 assign initial weights to the training instances without considering class skewness. This work assigns the initial weights to the training instances based on the class skewness. Moreover, the proposed ensemble rescales the weights assigned to the instances of each class after each iteration such that the total weight assigned to the instances belonging to each class remains equal. The proposed algorithms are assessed by employing the benchmark real-world imbalanced datasets downloaded from the KEEL dataset repository.

Although large margin distribution machine (LDM) can get superior classification and stronger generalization performance by maximizing the margin mean and minimizing the margin variance simultaneously, classifiers may be overwhelmed by the majority classes such that the minority class could have a lower detection rate due to ignoring the class imbalance. This is apparently contradict to the needs of high detection rate on the minority class in many real applications. Aiming at the above problem, this paper proposes an imbalanced cost-sensitive large margin distribution machine (ICS-LDM) to improve the detection rate of the minority class. First, when calculating the margin mean and margin variance, different weights are chosen on the sample margin between different types. And then, the objective function is optimized effectively by means of the cyclic dual coordinate descent method (Cyclic-DCD). Thus, a balanced distribution and maximum total margin is obtained by gradually increasing the margin distribution of the minority class. Finally, it is shown from experimental results that the proposed ICS-LDM can improve the classification accuracy of minority class and obtain more balanced detection rates on virtual dataset and UCI datasets. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of East China University of Science and Technology.

Imbalanced data consists of majority class and minority class, where the majority class leads to miss-classification of minority samples. Various approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this problem. Sampling, which focuses on balancing between classes, is one of the methods to solve the class imbalance problem. In previous our research, we have proposed Multivariate Normal Distribution based Over-Sampling (MNDO), which uses correlations between attributes and statistical methods, and have tackled this problem. In this paper, we propose Multivariate Normal Distribution based Over-sampling for Numerical and Categorical features (MNDO-NC) to sampling a dataset that contains both numerical data and categorical data. First, MNDO-NC generates numerical data using correlation coefficients and multivariate distribution. Next, calculate the distance between the generated data and the original data, and identify 5 nearest neighbors. The categorical data is sampled by applying a voting strategy for the neighborhood sample. Some existing methods generate new samples using distance function, but our method uses positive class statistics. Therefore, it can be applied even if the number of training samples is very small. In addition, outliers can be reproduced stochastically, so more realistic samples can be generated. In the experiment, we used 17 imbalanced datasets, which consist of numerical data and categorical data. To compare with the existing method, 6 sampling methods, 2 scaling and 3 learning methods were used. As a result of the experiment, the proposed method showed the same result as other methods. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

Fraudulent electricity consumption decreases the supply quality, increases generation load, causes legitimate consumers to pay excessive electricity bills, and affects the overall economy. The adaptation of smart grids can significantly reduce this loss through data analysis techniques. The smart grid infrastructure generates a massive amount of data, including the power consumption of individual users. Utilizing this data, machine learning and deep learning techniques can accurately identify electricity theft users. In this paper, an electricity theft detection system is proposed based on a combination of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture. CNN is a widely used technique that automates feature extraction and the classification process. Since the power consumption signature is time-series data, we were led to build a CNN-based LSTM (CNN-LSTM) model for smart grid data classification. In this work, a novel data pre-processing algorithm was also implemented to compute the missing instances in the dataset, based on the local values relative to the missing data point. Furthermore, in this dataset, the count of electricity theft users was relatively low, which could have made the model inefficient at identifying theft users. This class imbalance scenario was addressed through synthetic data generation. Finally, the results obtained indicate the proposed scheme can classify both the majority class (normal users) and the minority class (electricity theft users) with good accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.","Convolutional neural network (CNN); Data analysis; Electricity; Energy; Long short-term memory (LSTM); Machine learning; Non-technical loss; Smart grid","MDPI AG"

However, given the wide range of topics of Twitter users, tweets related to drug abuse are rare in most of the datasets. This imbalanced data remains a major issue in building effective tweet classifiers, and is especially obvious for studies that include abuse-related slang terms. In this study, we approach this problem by designing an ensemble deep learning model that leverages both word-level and character-level features to classify abuse-related tweets. Experiments are reported on a Twitter dataset, where we can configure the percentages of the two classes (abuse vs. non abuse) to simulate the data imbalance with different amplitudes.

Although credit card frauds occur extremely infrequently, they result in huge losses as most fraudulent transactions have large values. An adequate detection of fraud allows investigators to take timely actions that can potentially prevent additional fraud or financial losses. In practice, however, investigators can only check a few alerts per day since the investigation process can be long and tedious. Thus, the primary goal of the fraud detection model is to return accurate alerts with fewer false alarms and missed frauds. Conventional fraud detection is mainly based on the hybrid ensemble of diverse machine learning models. Recently, several studies have compared deep learning and traditional machine learning models including ensemble. However, these studies used evaluation methods without considering that the real-world fraud detection system operated with the constraints: (i) the number of investigators who check the high-risk transactions from the data-driven scoring models are limited and (ii) the two types of misclassification, false alarms and missed frauds, have different costs. In this study, we conducted an in-depth comparison between the hybrid ensemble and deep learning method to determine whether or not to adopt the latter in our partner's system that currently operates with the hybrid ensemble model. To compare the two, we introduced the champion-challenger framework and the development process of the two models. After developing the two models, we evaluated them on large transaction data sets taken from our partner, a major card issuing company in South Korea. We used various practical evaluation metrics appropriate for this domain that has severe class and cost imbalances. Moreover, we deployed these models in a real-world fraud detection system to check the post-launch performance for one month. The challenger outperformed the champion on both in off-line and post-launch tests. © 2019","Class imbalance; Credit card fraud detection; Deep learning; Hybrid ensemble; Model evaluation","Elsevier Ltd"

Here, neural-network analysis is used to test whether noninvasive phosphorus (31P) cardiovascular magnetic resonance spectroscopy (CMRS) measurements of cardiac adenosine triphosphate (ATP) energy, phosphocreatine (PCr), the first-order CK reaction rate kf, and the rate of ATP synthesis through CK (CK flux), can predict specific human heart disease and clinical severity. Methods: The data comprised the extant 178 complete sets of PCr and ATP concentrations, kf, and CK flux data from human CMRS studies performed on clinical 1.5 and 3 Tesla scanners. Healthy subjects and patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, dilated (DCM) or hypertrophic disease, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I-IV heart failure (HF), or with anterior myocardial infarction are included. Three-layer neural-networks were created to classify disease and to differentiate DCM, hypertrophy and clinical NYHA class in HF patients using leave-one-out training. Network performance was assessed using 'confusion matrices' and 'area-under-the-curve' (AUC) analyses of 'receiver operating curves'. Possible methodological bias and network imbalance were tested by segregating 1.5 and 3 Tesla data, and by data augmentation by random interpolation of nearest neighbors, respectively. Results: The network differentiated healthy, HF and non-HF cardiac disease with an overall accuracy of 84% and AUC &gt; 90% for each category using the four CK metabolic parameters, alone. HF patients with DCM, hypertrophy, and different NYHA severity were differentiated with ~ 80% overall accuracy independent of CMRS methodology. Conclusions: While sample-size was limited in some sub-classes, a neural network classifier applied to noninvasive cardiac 31P CMRS data, could serve as a metabolic biomarker for common disease types and HF severity with clinically-relevant accuracy. Moreover, the network's ability to individually classify disease and HF severity using CK metabolism alone, implies an intimate relationship between CK metabolism and disease, with subtle underlying phenotypic differences that enable their differentiation.

Typically, the reliability boundary that defines the operation rules is learned using a training database consisting of a large number of potential operation states. Many of these operation states are historical observations and these are typically all reliable operation states. However, to learn a classifier that can predict unseen operation states requires unreliable operation states as well. Thus, a statistical model is typically fitted to the historical observations, and then, unreliable operation states are sampled from this model. Still, the share of reliable states may be much larger than the portion of unreliable states. This imbalance in the data results in biasing the learning methods toward predicting reliable states with higher accuracy than unreliable states. However, an unreliable operating state involves (per-definition) a risk of failing system operation. Therefore, a higher accuracy is required in predicting unreliable states rather than in reliable states. This paper focuses on accounting for this bias when learning from imbalanced data. To optimally learn operation rules for an imbalanced training database a novel Optimal Classification Tree (OCT) is applied. We modify the OCT approach to address the corresponding bias that is introduced in an imbalanced training database. Our fully Controllable and Optimal Classification Tree (COCT) approach controls directly in the objective function the class weights of each operation state that is used for training. By using a database from the French transmission grid it is showcased how the proposed COCT method results in fewer missed alarms than the standard approach that is used to learn operation rules. © 2019 IEEE.",,"IEEE Computer Society"

However, transaction fraud incidents also occur frequently, causing a larger number of economic losses. Therefore, transaction fraud detection is significant. The methods of machine learning are often used to detect fraudulent transactions from a larger amount of transaction data. However, the class imbalance problem reduces the performance of these methods. There are mainly four factors causing this problem: imbalanced class distribution, sample size, class separability and within-class concept. The existing improvement strategies for class imbalance mainly focus on the first factor but omit other three ones. This paper considers the four factors to propose a comprehensive model called clustering tree. Constructing a clustering tree includes two steps: 1) we first select a clustering algorithm considering the class separability; and then 2) we use this clustering algorithm to construct a tree that can be used to determine if an incoming transaction is illegal. The root node of this tree contains all samples, and we consider both the imbalanced class distribution and the within-class concept when samples are hierarchically divided into sub-nodes during the constructing process. We compare the proposed method with five state-of-the-art ones on two real transaction datasets, and the experimental results show that our method works better. © 2019 IEEE.","Class imbalance; Clustering tree; Fraud detection; Machine learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The framework integrates learning-based feature selection, unsupervised risk rating, and imbalanced data resampling. For each vehicle, about 1300 driving behaviour features are extracted from trajectory data, which produce in-depth and multi-view measures on behaviours. To estimate the risk potentials of vehicles in driving, unsupervised data labelling is proposed. Based on extracted risk indicator features, vehicles are clustered into various groups labelled with graded risk levels. Data under-sampling of the safe group is performed to reduce the risk-safe class imbalance. Afterwards, the linkages between behaviour features and corresponding risk levels are built using XGBoost, and key features are identified according to feature importance ranking and recursive elimination. The risk levels of vehicles in driving are predicted based on key features selected.

This topic has attracted the attention of many computer scientists, as well as the financial sector. In computer science, a predictive model will be developed to analyse a firm's financial statements to predict its fate in the future based on the existing bankruptcy dataset. Many machine learning models have been developed to predict bankruptcy using specific datasets. This manuscript proposes a fast and accurate approach that utilises GPU-based extreme gradient boosting machine using squared logistics loss (SqLL) denoted by gXGBS for bankruptcy forecasting on both scenarios, including an imbalanced dataset (Korean bankruptcy dataset [KRBDS]) and two balanced datasets (USA bankruptcy dataset [USABDS] and Japanese bankruptcy dataset [JPNBDS]). To improve the performance of this prediction task, the study uses a custom loss function, namely SqLL, for an extreme gradient boosting machine to propose XGBS algorithm. Then, this study employs a GPU-based implementation of a decision tree construction algorithm (gDTC) to accelerate the processing time of XGBS. This is called a gXGBS algorithm. In addition, we also utilise a histogram-based tree construction algorithm using multi-GPU (gHTC), an approximation algorithm, for a gXGBS algorithm that will propose the third algorithm, namely gXGBS_hist, for the large datasets. The comprehensive experiments were conducted on three experimental datasets to evaluate the proposed approaches. The experimental results indicate that our proposed approaches outperform the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches for bankruptcy forecasting in terms of geometric mean (G-mean), Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and processing time for all experimental datasets. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Bankruptcy forecasting; Class imbalance problem; Extreme gradient boosting; GPU computing; Squared logistics loss","Elsevier Inc."

Most machine learning algorithms have their predictive performance negatively affected by imbalanced data. Although several techniques have been proposed to deal with this difficulty, they are usually restricted to binary classification datasets. Thus, one of the research challenges in this area is how to deal with imbalanced multiclass classification datasets. This challenge become more difficult when classes containing fewer instances are located in overlapping regions of the data attribute space. In fact, several studies have indicated that the degree of class overlapping has a higher effect on predictive performance than the global class imbalance ratio. This paper proposes a novel evolutionary ensemble-based method for multi-class imbalanced learning called the evolutionary inversion of class distribution in overlapping areas for multi-class imbalanced learning (EVINCI). EVINCI uses a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) to evolve a set of samples taken from an imbalanced dataset. It selectively reduces the concentration of less representative instances of the majority classes in the overlapping areas while selecting samples that produce more accurate models. In experiments performed to evaluate its predictive accuracy, EVINCI was superior to state-of-the-art ensemble-based methods for imbalanced learning. © 2019","Ensemble of classifiers; Evolutionary algorithms; Multi-Class imbalanced learning","Elsevier Inc."

Traditional classifiers usually produced suboptimal results for imbalanced data sets. This study proposed an idea of using a newly proposed bi-objective hybrid algorithm for the given classification task of binary imbalanced noisy and borderline data sets. The bi-objective hybrid algorithm was based on the hybridization of two metaheuristics, namely cuckoo search and covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. The validation of this proposed hybrid algorithm was confirmed in terms of the Pareto fronts. Thereafter, this algorithm was used in a methodology proposed for the classification task of the binary imbalanced data sets. The proposed methodology was based on an idea of estimating the probabilities from both classes (majority and minority) of a data set, using normal distribution. Optimization of parameters of the normal distribution was done with the help of the proposed algorithm. Different data sets (simulated, noisy borderline and real) were used. Four well-known classifiers with a preprocessing algorithm were cast-off for the comparison purpose. Performances of all classifiers were evaluated using three evaluation measures, sensitivity, G mean and F measure. A promising performance of proposed methodology was observed. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Bi-objective hybrid algorithm; Classification; Data mining; Imbalance data sets; Metaheuristics","Springer London"

This article describes our participation in this shared task. Materials and Methods: We followed a hybrid approach combining pattern-based, knowledge-intensive, and feature weighting techniques. After preprocessing the notes using publicly available natural language processing tools, we developed individual criterion-specific components that relied on collecting knowledge resources relevant for these criteria and pattern-based and weighting approaches to identify ""met"" and ""not met"" cases. Results: As part of the 2018 n2c2 challenge, 3 runs were submitted. The overall micro-averaged F1 on the training set was 0.9444. On the test set, the micro-averaged F1 for the 3 submitted runs were 0.9075, 0.9065, and 0.9056. The best run was placed second in the overall challenge and all 3 runs were statistically similar to the top-ranked system. A reimplemented system achieved the best overall F1 of 0.9111 on the test set. Discussion: We highlight the need for a focused resource-intensive effort to address the class imbalance in the cohort selection identification task. Conclusion: Our hybrid approach was able to identify all selection criteria with high F1 performance on both training and test sets. Based on our participation in the 2018 n2c2 task, we conclude that there is merit in continuing a focused criterion-specific analysis and developing appropriate knowledge resources to build a quality cohort selection system. © 2019 The Author(s).","clinical trial selection criteria; cohort identification; information storage and retrieval [L01.313.500.750.280]; information systems [L01.313.500.750.300]; natural language processing (L01.224.065.580)","Oxford University Press"

Machine learning models were shown to be effective in DAs, but the predictivity might be affected by data imbalance (i.e., more sensitizers than non-sensitizers) and limited information in the databases. To improve the predictivity of DAs, we attempted to apply data-rebalancing ensemble learning (bagging with support vector machine (SVM)) and a novel and comprehensive Cosmetics Europe database. For predicting human hazard and three-class potency, 12 models were built for each using a training set of 96 substances and a test set of 32 substances from the database. The model that predicted hazard with the highest accuracy (90.63% for the test set and 88.54% for the training set, named hazard-DA) used SVM-bagging with combinations of all variables (V6), while the model that predicted potency with the highest accuracy (68.75% for the test set and 82.29% for the training set, named potency-DA) used SVM alone. Both DAs showed better performance than LLNA and other machine learning-based DAs, and the potency-DA provided more in-depth assessment. These findings indicate that SVM-bagging-based DAs provide enhanced predictivity for hazard assessment by further data rebalancing. Meanwhile, the effect of imbalanced data might be offset by more detailed categorization of sensitizers for potency assessment, thus SVM-based DA without bagging could provide sufficient predictivity. The improved DAs in this study could be promising tools for skin sensitization assessment without animal testing. © The Authors, 2019.",,"ALTEX Edition"

These methods continue to provide reliable and standardized large scale screening of various image modalities to assist clinicians in identifying diseases. Since optic disc is the most important part of retinal fundus image for glaucoma detection, this paper proposes a two-stage framework that first detects and localizes optic disc and then classifies it into healthy or glaucomatous. Methods: The first stage is based on Regions with Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) and is responsible for localizing and extracting optic disc from a retinal fundus image while the second stage uses Deep Convolutional Neural Network to classify the extracted disc into healthy or glaucomatous. Unfortunately, none of the publicly available retinal fundus image datasets provides any bounding box ground truth required for disc localization. Therefore, in addition to the proposed solution, we also developed a rule-based semi-automatic ground truth generation method that provides necessary annotations for training RCNN based model for automated disc localization. Results: The proposed method is evaluated on seven publicly available datasets for disc localization and on ORIGA dataset, which is the largest publicly available dataset with healthy and glaucoma labels, for glaucoma classification. The results of automatic localization mark new state-of-the-art on six datasets with accuracy reaching 100% on four of them. For glaucoma classification we achieved Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve equal to 0.874 which is 2.7% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art results previously obtained for classification on ORIGA dataset. Conclusion: Once trained on carefully annotated data, Deep Learning based methods for optic disc detection and localization are not only robust, accurate and fully automated but also eliminates the need for dataset-dependent heuristic algorithms. Our empirical evaluation of glaucoma classification on ORIGA reveals that reporting only Area Under the Curve, for datasets with class imbalance and without pre-defined train and test splits, does not portray true picture of the classifier's performance and calls for additional performance metrics to substantiate the results. © 2019 The Author(s).","Computer aided diagnosis; Deep learning; Glaucoma detection; Machine learning; Medical image analysis; Optic disc localization","BioMed Central Ltd"

The main related lesions include soft exudates, hard exudates, microaneurysms, and haemorrhages. However, segmentation of these four kinds of lesions is difficult due to their uncertainty in size, contrast, and high interclass similarity. Therefore, we aim to design a multi-lesion segmentation model. We have designed the first small object segmentation network (L-Seg) that can segment the four kinds of lesions simultaneously. Taking into account that small lesion regions could not response at high level of network, we propose a multi-scale feature fusion method to handle this problem. In addition, when considering the cases of both class-imbalance and loss-imbalance problems, we propose a multi-channel bin loss. We have evaluated L-Seg on three fundus datasets including two publicly available datasets - IDRiD and e-ophtha and one private dataset - DDR. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that L-Seg achieves better performance in small lesion segmentation than other deep learning models and traditional methods. Specially, the mAUC score of L-Seg is over 16.8%, 1.51% and 3.11% higher than that of DeepLab v3+ on IDRiD, e-ophtha and DDR datasets, respectively.

Such problem consists of a data set with an extreme imbalance ratio where the events, the minority class, must be correctly detected given a time series denoting water quality and operative data on a minutely basis. First, the given data set is preprocessed for imputing missing data, adjusting concept drift and adding new statistical features, such as moving average, moving standard deviation, moving maximum and moving minimum. Next, two ensemble learning techniques are used, namely SMOTEBoost and RUSBoost. Such techniques have been developed specifically for dealing with imbalanced data, where the base learners are trained by adjusting the ratio between the classes. The first algorithm focuses on oversampling the minority class, while the second focuses on under-sampling the majority class. Finally, multiobjective optimisation is used for pruning the base models of such ensembles in order to maximise the prediction score without reducing generalisation performance. In the training phase, the model is trained, optimised and evaluated using hold-out validation on a given training data set. At the end, the trained model is inserted into a framework, which is used for online event detection and assessing the model's performance. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).","Anomaly detection; Evolutionary computation; Machine learning; Time series","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc"

Despite being diagnosed with ASD, some individuals exhibit outstanding scholastic, non-academic, and artistic capabilities, in such cases posing a challenging task for scientists to provide answers. In the last few years, ASD has been investigated by social and computational intelligence scientists utilizing advanced technologies such as machine learning to improve diagnostic timing, precision, and quality. Machine learning is a multidisciplinary research topic that employs intelligent techniques to discover useful concealed patterns, which are utilized in prediction to improve decision making. Machine learning techniques such as support vector machines, decision trees, logistic regressions, and others, have been applied to datasets related to autism in order to construct predictive models. These models claim to enhance the ability of clinicians to provide robust diagnoses and prognoses of ASD. However, studies concerning the use of machine learning in ASD diagnosis and treatment suffer from conceptual, implementation, and data issues such as the way diagnostic codes are used, the type of feature selection employed, the evaluation measures chosen, and class imbalances in data among others. A more serious claim in recent studies is the development of a new method for ASD diagnoses based on machine learning. This article critically analyses these recent investigative studies on autism, not only articulating the aforementioned issues in these studies but also recommending paths forward that enhance machine learning use in ASD with respect to conceptualization, implementation, and data.

However, randomly removing majority examples via a uniform distribution may lead to unnecessary information loss. This would result in performance deterioration of classifiers trained using this rebalanced dataset. On the other hand, examples have different sensitivities with respect to class imbalance. Higher sensitivity means that this example is more easily to be affected by class imbalance, which can be used to guide the selection of examples to rebalance the class distribution and to boost the classifier performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel undersampling method, the UnderSampling using Sensitivity (USS), based on sensitivity of each majority example. Examples with low sensitivities are noisy or safe examples while examples with high sensitivities are borderline examples.

Highly diverse silencing suppressor proteins have been developed by them due to their counter defensive strategy. Silencing suppressor proteins groups share very low sequence as well as structural similarities among them. Therefore, these proteins obstruct their annotation using sequence similarity-based search techniques. Machine learning techniques can offer an alternative and effective way to solve this problem. However, the optimal performance through machine learning based techniques is being predominantly affected by diverse factors, such as availability of irrelevant and/or redundant features, class imbalance, and selection of suitable learning algorithm. In the current study, we present a novel approach to improve the prediction performance for the RNA silencing suppressors by using fuzzy rough feature selection technique with rank as well as evolutionary search on optimally balanced dataset.

Although HH seems to lower healthcare costs by shortening hospital stays and improving patient's quality of life, the lack of continuous observation at home may lead to complications in some patients. Since blood tests have been proven to provide relevant prognosis information in many diseases, this paper analyzes the impact of different sampling methods on the prediction of HH outcomes. After a first exploratory analysis, some variables extracted from routine blood tests performed at the moment of HH admission, such as hemoglobin, lymphocytes or creatinine, were found to unmask statistically significant differences between patients undergoing successful and unsucessful HH stays. Then, predictive models were built with these data, in order to identify unsuccessful cases eventually needing hospital facilities. However, since these hospital admissions during HH programs are rare, their identification through conventional machine-learning approaches is challenging. Thus, several sampling strategies designed to face class imbalance were herein overviewed and compared.

A key factor influencing the accuracy of fault diagnosis lies in the imbalance data distribution between majority classes (i.e., normal situations) and minority classes (i.e., faulty situations), which may cause misjudgments of faults and lead to failure in practical use. This study proposes an ensemble classification method called AdaWELM ensemble algorithm for fault diagnosis in wastewater treatment which builds up individual classifiers by using weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) and combines them with Adaboost ensemble algorithm. The weight matrix in WELM can be updated adaptively along with the iteration of Adaboost learning. The simulations based on 25 benchmark datasets from KEEL repository are arranged at first and the results show the proposed classifier outperforms the other comparative classifiers for most of the evaluated datasets. And then, a practical fault diagnosis model in wastewater treatment plant based on AdaWELM ensemble algorithm is built and the simulations verifies that, comparing with several classifiers, this fault diagnosis model can efficiently improve the performance of WWTP, especially improve the accuracy of faulty class and G-mean value. So we think the proposed AdaWELM ensemble method could be a promising solution for imbalanced data classification in WWTPs.Through experiments, we find that the performance of G-mean value and accuracy of minority class in a case study of WWTPs are improved by comparing with several other related classification algorithms. © 2019 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","AdaBoost algorithm; Data classification; Imbalanced data; Wastewater treatment plant; Weighted extreme learning machine","IEEE Computer Society"

To increase transparency and help reduce fraud, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) have made several data sets publicly available for analysis. Our research group has conducted several studies using CMS data and traditional machine learning algorithms (non-deep learning), but challenges associated with severe class imbalance leave room for improvement. These previous studies serve as baselines as we employ deep neural networks with various data-sampling techniques to determine the efficacy of deep learning in addressing class imbalance. Random over-sampling (ROS), random under-sampling (RUS), and combinations of the two (ROS-RUS) are applied to study how varying levels of class imbalance impact model training and performance. Classwise performance is maximized by identifying optimal decision thresholds, and a strong linear relationship between minority class size and optimal threshold is observed. Results show that ROS significantly outperforms RUS, combining RUS and ROS both maximizes performance and efficiency with a 4 x speedup in training time, and the default threshold of 0.5 is never optimal when training data is imbalanced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to provide statistical results comparing ROS, RUS, and ROS-RUS deep learning methods across a range of class distributions.

This research demonstrates how supervised machine learning can be used to predict adults at risk for OUD by considering interactions between various demographic, socioeconomic, physical, and psychological features in an integrated manner. A labeled data set was built from the responses to the 2016 edition of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). This labeled data set was used to train and test a random forest classifier while accounting for class imbalance. The classifier can predict adults at risk for OUD accurately (sensitivity = 0.81, specificity = 0.76, AUC = 0.86), although the prevalence of OUD is only about 1%. Early initiation of marijuana (prior to 18 years of age) emerges as the dominant predictor for developing OUD in adult life. This is surprising because it ranks higher than both mental illness and disability; two conditions that are often comorbid with substance use disorders. Thus, curbing early initiation of marijuana may be the best prevention strategy. This highlights the crucial role that educators, counselors, and parents can play in alleviating the United States' opioid overdose crisis. © 2019 IEEE.","Early Initiation of Marijuana; Machine Learning; Opioid Use Disorder; Random Forest","IEEE Computer Society"

This paper proposes a novel dynamic SMOTE (synthetic minority oversampling technique)-based RoF algorithm for the multi-class imbalance problem. The main idea of the proposed method is to dynamically balance the class distribution before building each rotation decision tree. A resampling rate is set in each iteration (ranging from 10% in the first iteration to 100% in the last) and this ratio defines the number of minority class instances randomly resampled (with replacement) from the original dataset in each iteration. The rest of the minority class instances are generated by the SMOTE method.

However, few of the algorithms have focused on and solved the problems of concept drift and class imbalance. Due to changes in the macroeconomic environment and markets, the relationship between client characteristics and credit assessment results may change over time, causing concept drift in client credit assessments. Moreover, client credit assessment data are naturally asymmetric and class imbalanced because of the screening of clients. Aiming at solving the joint research issue of concept drift and class imbalance in client credit assessments, in this paper, a novel sample-based online learning ensemble (SOLE) for client credit assessment is proposed. A novel multiple time scale ensemble classifier and a novel sample-based online class imbalance learning procedure are proposed to handle the potential concept drift and class imbalance in the client credit assessment data streams. The experiments are carried out on two real-world client credit assessment cases, which present a comprehensive comparison between the proposed SOLE and other state-of-the-art online learning algorithms. In addition, the base classifier preference and the computing resource consumption of all the comparative algorithms are tested. In general, SOLE achieves a better performance than other methods using fewer computing resources.

In this paper, we propose a two-stage data balancing scheme for text sentiment classification, which not only can make the data boundary clear, but also can balance the class distribution of training data set. The core algorithm LDMRC of the scheme is proposed based on the shortest distance from a point to a straight line, to remove some majority class texts in the neighborhood of a minority class text for balancing the class distribution of data in the local dense mixed region. The second stage employs SS or RS as a data rebalancing strategy to globally balance the training dataset after local dense mixed region cutting. The proposed two-stage data balancing scheme is used by situating at the front of a learning algorithm such as SVM. Using the machine learning algorithm SVM on eight imbalanced data sets including Book_c, Hotel, Jadeite, Insurance in Chinese, and DVD, Book_e, Electronics, Kitchen in English, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that LDMRC is superior to the best existing cutting algorithm BRC for Acc, RN and FN.

The biological function of a protein is tightly connected to its specific 3D structure. Prediction of the protein secondary structure is a crucial intermediate step towards elucidating its 3D structure and function. Traditional experimental methods for prediction of protein structure are expensive and time-consuming. Nevertheless, the average accuracy of the suggested solutions has hardly reached beyond 80%. The possible underlying reasons are the ambiguous sequence-structure relation, noise in input protein data, class imbalance, and the high dimensionality of the encoding schemes. Furthermore, we utilize a compound string dissimilarity measure to directly interpret protein sequence content and avoid information loss. In order to improve accuracy, we employ two different classifiers including support vector machine and fuzzy nearest neighbor and collectively aggregate the classification outcomes to infer the final protein structures. We conduct comprehensive experiments to compare our model with the current state-of-the-art approaches. The experimental results demonstrate that given a set of input sequences, our multi-component framework can accurately predict the protein structure. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of our unified model can be further enhanced through framework configuration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Ensemble prediction machine; Fuzzy k-nearest neighbor; Protein secondary structure prediction; Support vector machine","Elsevier Ltd"

The objective of this study is to implement machine learning tools (i.e., classification-based tools in particular) for predicting the structural responses and the fragility curves. In this regard, ten different classification-based methods are explored: logistic regression, lasso regression, support vector machine, Naïve Bayes, decision tree, random forest, linear and quadratic discriminant analyses, neural networks, and K-nearest neighbors with the structural responses resulted from the multiple strip analyses. In addition, this study examines the impact of class imbalance in training dataset, which is typical among data of structural responses, when developing classification-based models for predicting structural responses. The statistical results using the implemented dataset demonstrate that among applied methods, random forest and quadratic discriminant analysis are, respectively, preferable with the imbalanced and balanced datasets since they show the highest efficiency in predicting the structural responses. Moreover, a detailed procedure is presented on how to derive the fragility curves based on the classification-based tools. Finally, the sensitivity of the applied machine learning methods to the size of employed dataset is investigated. The results explain that logistic regression, lasso regression, and Naïve Bayes are not sensitive to the size of dataset (i.e., the number of performed time history analyses); while the performance of discriminant analysis significantly depends on the size of applied dataset. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fragility curve; Imbalanced dataset; Machine learning tools; Multiple strip analysis; Random forest; Support vector machine","Elsevier Ltd"

The class imbalance problem exists when the number of instances present in a class (or classes) is significantly fewer than the number of instances belonging to another class (or classes). Sufficiently recognizing the minority class during classification is a problem as most algorithms employed to learn from data input are biased toward the majority class. The underlying issue is made more complex with the presence of data difficult factors embedded in such data input. This paper presents a novel and effective ensemble-based method for dealing with the class imbalance problem. This paper is motivated by the idea of moving the oversampling from the data level to the algorithm level, instead of increasing the minority instances in the data sets, the algorithms in this paper aims to 'oversample the classification ensemble' by increasing the number of classifiers that represent the minority class in the ensemble, i.e., random forest. The proposed biased random forest algorithm employs the nearest neighbor algorithm to identify the critical areas in a given data set. The standard random forest is then fed with more random trees generated based on the critical areas. The results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective in dealing with the class imbalance problem. © 2012 IEEE.","Class imbalance; classification; nearest neighbor; random forest","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Machine-learning-based methods have been extensively used for the prediction of protein-DNA binding sites. However, the data imbalance problem, in which the number of nonbinding residues (negative-class samples) is far larger than that of binding residues (positive-class samples), seriously restricts the performance improvements of machine-learning-based predictors. In this work, we designed a two-stage imbalanced learning algorithm, called ensembled hyperplane-distance-based support vector machines (E-HDSVM), to improve the prediction performance of protein-DNA binding sites. The first stage of E-HDSVM designs a new iterative sampling algorithm, called hyperplane-distance-based under-sampling (HD-US), to extract multiple subsets from the original imbalanced data set, each of which is used to train a support vector machine (SVM). Unlike traditional sampling algorithms, HD-US selects samples by calculating the distances between the samples and the separating hyperplane of the SVM. The second stage of E-HDSVM proposes an enhanced AdaBoost (EAdaBoost) algorithm to ensemble multiple trained SVMs. As an enhanced version of the original AdaBoost algorithm, EAdaBoost overcomes the overfitting problem. Stringent cross-validation and independent tests on benchmark data sets demonstrated the superiority of E-HDSVM over several popular imbalanced learning algorithms. Based on the proposed E-HDSVM algorithm, we further implemented a sequence-based protein-DNA binding site predictor, called DNAPred, which is freely available at http://csbio.njust.edu.cn/bioinf/dnapred/ for academic use. The computational experimental results showed that our predictor achieved an average overall accuracy of 91.7% and a Mathew's correlation coefficient of 0.395 on five benchmark data sets and outperformed several state-of-the-art sequence-based protein-DNA binding site predictors. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"American Chemical Society"

Existing frameworks for question answering are not suitable for this task, due to the inherent scarcity and imbalance in the legal contract data available for training. We propose a question answering system which first identifies the excerpt in the contract which potentially contains the answer to a given question, and then builds a multi-class classifier to choose the answer to the question, based on the content of this excerpt. Unlike existing question answering systems, the proposed system explicitly handles the imbalance in the data, by generating synthetic instances of the minority answer categories, using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. This ensures that the number of instances in all the classes are roughly equal to each other, thus leading to more accurate and reliable classification.

The performance dramatically degrades due to the missing data of old classes. Incremental learning methods have been proposed to retain the knowledge acquired from the old classes, by using knowledge distilling and keeping a few exemplars from the old classes. However, these methods struggle to textbf{scale up to a large number of classes. We believe this is because of the combination of two factors: (a) the data imbalance between the old and new classes, and (b) the increasing number of visually similar classes. Distinguishing between an increasing number of visually similar classes is particularly challenging, when the training data is unbalanced. We propose a simple and effective method to address this data imbalance issue. We found that the last fully connected layer has a strong bias towards the new classes, and this bias can be corrected by a linear model.

In particular, we present a study of multiple techniques focused on the mitigation of these problems, that are used in combination with interpretable models. Our results indicate that the use of oversampling along with sliding windows can improve the resulting AUC of models (up to reaching a mean AUC of 0.80 in our dataset), and FCBF can be used to drastically reduce the number of predictors, obtaining simpler models with a slight AUC reduction (from a mean number of predictors of 69.78 to 16.28, achieving a mean AUC of 0.76).

By treating the question of whether a student offered admission will accept it as a binary classification problem, we implemented a number of different classifiers and then evaluated the performance of these algorithms using the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure and area under the receiver operator curve. The results from this study indicate that the logistic regression classifier performed best in modeling the student college commitment decision problem, i.e., predicting whether a student will accept an admission offer, with an AUC score of 79.6%. The significance of this research is that it demonstrates that many institutions could use machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of their estimates of entering class sizes, thus allowing more optimal allocation of resources and better control over net tuition revenue. © 2019 by the authors.

Therefore the range of theft and fraud transactions have widely increased. In order to detect both the fraud and non-fraud transactions Credit card fraud detection system (CCFD) is used. Credit card fraud detection system is proposed using machine learning techniques. The two main important algorithm techniques used in this system are whale optimization algorithm(WOA) and Smote(synthetic minority oversampling technique). The Smote technique is used to solve Class imbalance problem. The Whale optimization algorithm comprises mainly of three operators which are used to stimulate the search for prey, encircling prey and bubble-net scratch around the behaviour of humpback whales. It is also used to increase the efficiency of the credit card fraud detection system. The Smote technique is used to solve Class imbalance problem. Thus by using the SMOTE technique and Whale optimization algorithm credit card fraud detection system solves the problem of data imbalance, reliability, data optimization, and improvises the convergence speed. © BEIESP.","Credit card fraud detection; Kaggle datasets; Smote technique; Whale optimization algorithm","Blue Eyes Intelligence Engineering and Sciences Publication"

We have earlier reported the use of Long Short Term Memory (LSTM)networks-trained on normal ECG patterns-to the detection of anomalies from the prediction errors for real-time diagnostic applications. In this work, we extend our anomaly detection algorithm by introducing a second stage predictor that can identify the actual anomaly class from the error outputs of the first stage model. Results from seven types of anomalies have been presented including Atrial Premature Contraction (APC), Paced Beat (PB), Premature Ventricular Contraction (PVC), Right Bundle Branch Block (RBBB), Ventricular Bigeminy (VB), Ventricular Couplets (VCs)and Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). To optimize anomaly class prediction performance, multiple choices of second stage models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP), support vector machine (SVM)and logistic regression have been employed. A featurization scheme for LSTM prediction errors in the form of overall summaries has been proposed and a successful predictor for the same was developed with good performance. Our results indicate that the error vectors represented by their summary features carry useful predictive information about actual ECG anomaly type. We discuss how the accuracy scores without attention to inherent class imbalances and paucity of data instances may produce misleading performance estimates and hence accurate background models are needed to estimate true predictive performance of multi-class predictors such as those presented in this work.

However, typical gene expression data usually presents a high-dimensional imbalanced characteristic, which poses severe challenge for traditional machine learning methods to construct a robust classifier performing well on both the minority and majority classes. As one of the most successful feature weighting techniques, Relief is considered to particularly suit to handle high-dimensional problems. Unfortunately, almost all relief-based methods have not taken the class imbalance distribution into account. This study identifies that existing Relief-based algorithms may underestimate the features with the discernibility ability of minority classes, and ignore the distribution characteristic of minority class samples. As a result, an additional bias towards being classified into the majority classes can be introduced. To this end, a new method, named imRelief, is proposed for efficiently handling high-dimensional imbalanced gene expression data. imRelief can correct the bias towards to the majority classes, and consider the scattered distributional characteristic of minority class samples in the process of estimating feature weights. This way, imRelief has the ability to reward the features which perform well at separating the minority classes from other classes. Experiments on four microarray gene expression data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of imRelief in both feature weighting and feature subset selection applications. © 2019","Feature selection; Imbalanced data classification; Microarray gene expression data; Relief","Elsevier Ltd"

A disproportion among objects from different classes may significantly affect the performance of standard classification models. The first problem is the high imbalance ratios that pose a serious learning difficulty and require usage of dedicated methods, capable of alleviating this issue. The second important problem which may appear is noise, which may be accompanying the training data and causing strong deterioration of the classifier performance or increase the time required for its training. Therefore, the desirable classification model should be robust to both skewed data distributions and noise. One of the most popular approaches for handling imbalanced data is oversampling of the minority objects in their neighborhood. In this work we will criticize this approach and propose a novel strategy for dealing with imbalanced data, with particular focus on the noise presence. We propose Radial-Based Oversampling (RBO) method, which can find regions in which the synthetic objects from minority class should be generated on the basis of the imbalance distribution estimation with radial basis functions.

In spite of performance losses due to Class Imbalance, this issue has not been thoroughly studied in Network Traffic Classification and some previous works are limited to few solutions and/or assumed misleading methodological approaches. In this article, we deal with Class Imbalance in Network Traffic Classification, studying the presence of this phenomenon and analyzing a wide number of solutions in two different Internet environments: a lab network and a high-speed backbone. Namely, we experimented with 21 data-level algorithms, six ensemble methods and one cost-level approach.

And last but not least, the strategies to tune parameters and our algorithm implementations to adapt binary methods to multiclass problems are presented and shared with the research community, including two ensemble techniques used for the first time in Machine Learning to the best of our knowledge.

One leading case has been the use of Yelp reviews to target food safety inspections. While previous research on data from Seattle finds that Yelp reviews can predict unhygienic establishments, we provide a more cautionary perspective. First, we show that prior results are sensitive to what we call “Extreme Imbalanced Sampling”: extreme because the dataset was restricted from roughly 13k inspections to a sample of only 612 inspections with only extremely high or low inspection scores, and imbalanced by not accounting for class imbalance in the population. We show that extreme imbalanced sampling is responsible for claims about the power of Yelp information in the original classification setup. Second, a re-analysis that utilizes the full dataset of 13k inspections and models the full inspection score (regression instead of classification) shows that (a) Yelp information has lower predictive power than prior inspection history and (b) Yelp reviews do not significantly improve predictions, given existing information about restaurants and inspection history. Contrary to prior claims, Yelp reviews do not appear to aid regulatory targeting. Third, this case study highlights critical issues when using social media for predictive models in governance and corroborates recent calls for greater transparency and reproducibility in machine learning. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.","Consumer reviews; Food safety; Regulation; Replication; Yelp","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc"

The goal of stance detection is to categorize an overall position of a subject towards an object into one of the four classes: agree, disagree, discuss, and unrelated. One of the major problems faced by current machine learning models used for stance detection is caused by a severe class imbalance among these classes. Hence, most models fail to correctly classify instances that fall into minority classes. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a hierarchical representation of these classes, which combines the agree, disagree, and discuss classes under a new related class. Further, we propose a two-layer neural network that learns from this hierarchical representation and controls the error propagation between the two layers using the Maximum Mean Discrepancy regularizer. Compared with conventional four-way classifiers, this model has two advantages: (1) the hierarchical architecture mitigates the class imbalance problem; (2) the regularization makes the model to better discern between the related and unrelated stances.

However, this must be based on the assumption that different classes are mutually exclusive. In real applications, the above assumption does not always hold. For example, the same book may belong to multiple subjects. From this point of view, researchers were motivated to formulate multi-label learning problems. In this context, each instance can be assigned multiple labels but the classifiers training is still typically undertaken in the setting of single-task learning. When probabilistic approaches are adopted for classifiers training, multi-task learning can be enabled through transformation of a multi-labelled data set into several binary data sets. The above data transformation could usually result in the class imbalance issue. Without the above data transformation, multi-labelling of data results in an exponential increase of the number of classes, leading to fewer instances for each class and a higher difficulty for identifying each class. In addition, multi-labelling of data is very time consuming and expensive in some application areas, such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we introduce a novel formulation of the hate speech type identification problem in the setting of multi-task learning through our proposed fuzzy ensemble approach. In this setting, single-labelled data can be used for semi-supervised multi-label learning and two new metrics (detection rate and irrelevance rate) are thus proposed to measure more effectively the performance for this kind of learning tasks. We report an experimental study on identification of four types of hate speech, namely: religion, race, disability and sexual orientation. The experimental results show that our proposed fuzzy ensemble approach outperforms other popular probabilistic approaches, with an overall detection rate of 0.93. © 2019 IW3C2 (International World Wide Web Conference Committee), published under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0 License.","Cyberhate detection; Fuzzy classification; Machine learning; Multi-task learning; Text classification","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc"

Early detection is the only rescue to reduce the risk of breast cancer mortality. Traditional methods cannot effectively diagnose tumor since they are based on the assumption of well-balanced dataset.. However, a hybrid method can help to alleviate the two-class imbalance problem existing in the diagnosis of breast cancer and establish a more accurate diagnosis. Material and Methods: The proposed hybrid approach was based on improved Laplacian score (LS) and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithms called LS-KNN. An improved LS algorithm was used for obtaining the optimal feature subset. The KNN with automatic K was utilized for classifying the data which guaranteed the effectiveness of the proposed method by reducing the computational effort and making the classification more faster. The effectiveness of LS-KNN was also examined on two biased-representative breast cancer datasets using classification accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Results: Applying the proposed algorithm on two breast cancer datasets indicated that the efficiency of the new method was higher than the previously introduced methods. The obtained values of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, G-mean, and Matthews correlation coefficient were 99.27%, 99.12%, 99.51%, 99.42%, respectively.

Twenty-two patients had grade 2 or higher RP. Four methods were investigated, including feature selection (case A) and feature extraction (case B) with traditional machine learning methods, a VAE-MLP joint architecture (case C) with deep learning and lastly, the combination of feature selection and joint architecture (case D). For feature selection, Random forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) were implemented to select relevant features. Specifically, each method was run for multiple times to rank features within several cross-validated (CV) resampled sets. A collection of ranking lists were then aggregated by top 5% and Kemeny graph methods to identify the final ranking for prediction. A synthetic minority oversampling technique was applied to correct for class imbalance during this process. For deep learning, a VAE-MLP joint architecture where a VAE aimed for dimensionality reduction and an MLP aimed for classification was developed. In this architecture, reconstruction loss and prediction loss were combined into a single loss function to realize simultaneous training and weights were assigned to different classes to mitigate class imbalance. To evaluate the prediction performance and conduct comparisons, the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were performed for nested CVs for both handcrafted feature selections and the deep learning approach. The significance of differences in AUCs was assessed using the DeLong test of U-statistics. Results: An MLP-based method using weight pruning (WP) feature selection yielded the best performance among the different hand-crafted feature selection methods (case A), reaching an AUC of 0.804 (95% CI: 0.761–0.823) with 29 top features. A VAE-MLP joint architecture (case C) achieved a comparable but slightly lower AUC of 0.781 (95% CI: 0.737–0.808) with the size of latent dimension being 2. The combination of handcrafted features (case A) and latent representation (case D) achieved a significant AUC improvement of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.805–0.863) with 22 features (P-value = 0.000642 compared with handcrafted features only (Case A) and P-value = 0.000453 compared to VAE alone (Case C)) with an MLP classifier. Conclusion: The potential for combination of traditional machine learning methods and deep learning VAE techniques has been demonstrated for dealing with limited datasets in modeling radiotherapy toxicities. Specifically, latent variables from a VAE-MLP joint architecture are able to complement handcrafted features for the prediction of RP and improve prediction over either method alone. © 2019 American Association of Physicists in Medicine","deep neural networks; feature selection; machine learning; radiotherapy outcome modeling","John Wiley and Sons Ltd"

We report the convergence validity of a very brief, self-administered, computerized assessment protocol against one of the most extensively used, clinician-administered instruments—the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Method: Two hundred six participants (mean age = 67.44, standard deviation [SD] = 11.63) completed the MoCA and the computerized test. Three machine learning algorithms (ie, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Trees) were trained to classify participants according to the clinical cutoff score of the MoCA (ie, < 26) from participant performance on 25 features of the computerized test. Analysis employed Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnic to correct the sample for class imbalance. Results: Gradient Boosting Trees achieved the highest performance (accuracy = 0.81, specificity = 0.88, sensitivity = 0.74, F1 score = 0.79, and area under the curve = 0.81). A subsequent K-means clustering of the prediction features yielded 3 categories that corresponded to the unimpaired (mean = 26.98, SD = 2.35), mildly impaired (mean = 23.58, SD = 3.19), and moderately impaired (mean = 17.24, SD = 4.23) ranges of MoCA score (F = 222.36, P <.00). In addition, compared to the MoCA, the computerized test correlated more strongly with age in unimpaired participants (ie, MoCA ≥26, n = 165), suggesting greater sensitivity to age-related changes in cognitive functioning. Conclusion: Future studies should examine ways to improve the sensitivity of the computerized test by expanding the cognitive domains it measures without compromising its efficiency. © The Author(s) 2019.","cognitive impairment; dementia; machine learning; primary care; screening","SAGE Publications Inc."

Using foot-by-foot track geometry and tonnage data, this paper develops a new machine learning based approach to identify the track geometry parameters that contribute most to the prediction of rail defects occurrences. Taking more than 60 types of track geometry measurements into account, this study develops a Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm for feature selection and compares its results with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). In addition, to capture more knowledge from the geometry data, some additional features, including Track Quality Index (TQI), energy spectral density, and time-trend are extracted. This, in turn, facilitates the learning and predicting process. Moreover, since there exists a very limited number of rail defects, the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling Approach (ADASYN) is applied to overcome the issue of imbalance in the dataset. In terms of machine learning algorithms, the proposed approach employs an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in which the hyper-parameters are optimized using a Bayesian optimization method. Furthermore, the proposed approach investigates the impact of each track geometry parameter as well as a subset of them on rail defects occurrences with Partial Dependence Analysis (PDA). Finally, our approach is implemented on a six-year dataset with over 60 million track geometry records collected from a 100-mile section of a U.S. Class I railroad to demonstrate its applicability and efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Extreme gradient boosting; Foot-by-foot track geometry; Imbalanced dataset; Partial dependence analysis; Rail defect prediction","Elsevier Ltd"

Datasets that have skewed class distribution raise hindrance to the traditional learning algorithms. Traditional classifiers give the same importance to all the samples, which leads to the prediction biased towards the majority classes. To solve this intrinsic deficiency, numerous strategies have been proposed such as weighted extreme learning machine (WELM), weighted support vector machine (WSVM), class-specific extreme learning machine (CS-ELM) and class-specific kernelized extreme learning machine (CSKELM). This work focuses on multiclass imbalance problems, which are more difficult compared to the binary class imbalance problems. Kernelized extreme learning machine (KELM) yields better results compared to the traditional extreme learning machine (ELM), which uses random input parameters. This work presents a generalized CSKELM (GCSKELM), the extension of our recently proposed CSKELM, which addresses the multiclass imbalanced problems more effectively. The proposed GCSKELM can be applied directly to solve the multiclass imbalanced problems. GCSKELM with Gaussian kernel function avoids the non-optimal hidden node problem associated with CS-ELM and other existing variants of ELM. The proposed work also has less computational cost in contrast with kernelized WELM (KWELM) for multiclass imbalanced learning. This work employs class-specific regularization parameters, which are determined by employing class proportion. The extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed work obtains promising generalization performance in contrast with the other state-of-the-art imbalanced learning methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Classification; Generalized class-specific kernelized extreme learning machine; Kernelized extreme learning machine; Multiclass imbalanced learning","Elsevier Ltd"

To address imbalanced datasets, a weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) solving the L2-regularized weighted least squares problem is presented to avoid the generation of an over-fitting model and obtain better generalization ability compared with ELM. However, the weight generated according to class distribution of training data leads to lack of finding optimal weight with good generalization performance and the randomness of input weight and hidden biases of network makes the algorithm produce suboptimal classification model. In this paper, a weighted extreme learning machine based on hybrid artificial bee colony (HABC) is proposed to obtain better performance than WELM, in which input weights and hidden bias of WELM and the weight assigned to training samples are optimized by the hybrid artificial bee colony algorithm. HABC combines the diversities of the perturbed parameter vectors of differential evolution with the best solution information of the artificial bee colony effectively. In the empirical study, different class imbalance data handling methods including four WELM-based methods, weighted support vector machine, four ensemble methods which combine data sampling and the Bagging or Boosting are compared with our method.

A dataset is said to be imbalanced when the number of instances belonging to one class is much less than the number of instances belonging to the other class. Classifiers that proves efficient on standard data fail when the data is imbalanced as they are over trained by the majority class instances. Since class imbalance is a common characteristic of real-world data, the need for better classifiers becomes essential. This paper proposes a novel instance-based classification algorithm called Weighted Pattern Matching based Classification (PMC+) for classifying imbalanced data. PMC+ classifies unlabelled instances by computing the absolute difference between the feature values of the instances in the dataset and the unlabelled instance. PMC+ employs a simple classification procedure with weights and shows reasonably good performance. To improve the performance of PMC+, Fireworks based Feature and Weight Selection algorithm based on the idea of PMC+ has been proposed. PMC+ is evaluated on 44 binary imbalanced datasets and 15 multiclass imbalanced datasets. Although PMC+ does not employ a resampling or cost-sensitive method, experiments show that PMC+ is effective for classification of imbalanced data.

The ECBDL'14 dataset was the big data target in the competition, and it consisted of 631 attributes and about 32 million instances, of which about 98% belonged to the negative class. The ECBDL'14 competition dataset has recently been used in the literature to assess the effect of class imbalance on big data analytics. The contribution of our paper is two-fold. First, a survey of several literature works that utilized the EDBDL'14 dataset, either fully or partially, is presented. Second, compared to the Random Oversampling approach used by the winning algorithm for the competition, we utilize a Random Undersampling approach in conjunction with a Feature Selection approach. Through Random Undersampling, different class distributions were generated, ranging from slightly imbalanced to balanced. Prior to sampling, we perform Feature Selection by computing Feature Importance with the Random Forest learner within the Apache Spark framework. Subsequently, classification performance is computed for Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient-Boosted Trees in the same big data analytics framework. The key results of our study indicate that our proposed solution had a higher prediction performance (minimally) compared to that of the highest value of the winning algorithm. However, it is important to note that Random Undersampling, compared to Random Oversampling, imposes a lower computational burden and results in a faster training time, which is beneficial to data analytics.

This problem brings a preference of the classifier to the majority class, which leads to worse performance of the classifier on the minority class. We proposed an improved boosting tree(BT) algorithm for learning imbalanced data, called cost BT. In each iteration of the cost BT, only the weights of the misclassified minority class samples are increased. Meanwhile, the error rate in the weight formula of the base classifier is replaced by 1 minus F-measure. In this study, the performance of the cost BT algorithm is compared with other known methods on 9 public data sets. The compared methods include the decision tree and random forest algorithm, and both of them were combined with the sampling techniques such as synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), Borderline-SMOTE, adaptive synthetic sampling approach (ADASYN) and one sided selection. The cost BT algorithm performed better than the other compared methods in F-measure, G-mean and area under curve (AUC). In 6 of the 9 data sets, the cost BT algorithm has a superior performance to the other published methods. It can promote the prediction performance of the base classifiers by increasing the proportion of the minority class in the whole samples with only increasing the weights of the misclassified minority class samples in each iteration of the BT. In addition, computing the weights of the base classifiers with F-measure is helpful to the ensemble decisions. © 2019, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

Machine learning classifiers suffers significantly while learning from the imbalance data. Within imbalance class data, a class covers a very small portion of the whole dataset also known as minority class or the positive class, generally are the most significant. The issue that plays the key responsibility for these degradation's of performance is primarily the distribution of different class of samples within the dataset. It is the presence of local sub-concepts from different classes within the domain of another class. Recent time, a number of studies have concentrated on categorizing the minority class into several sub-categories or sub-concepts based on their logical neighbourhood. For this purpose-these studies have utilized methods like K nearest neighbour and kernel method. This study aimed at improving the categorization process of the minority class by incorporating an idea of using dataset specific distance function for the categorization process.

This results in a severe sparsity (i. e., class imbalance) of the outcome variable, which impedes predictive modeling. To alleviate this, we develop machine learning models for spatio-temporal prediction that are specifically adjusted for an imbalanced distribution of the class labels and test them in an actual setting with state-of-the-art predictors (i. e., socio-economic, geographical, temporal, meteorological, and crime variables in fine resolution).

Recent studies have revealed conflicting results likely due to failure to take into account the class imbalance problem commonly seen with medical data. We developed a new ML approach to predict 30 day HF readmission or death and compared the performance of this model with other commonly used prediction models. Methods and results: We identified all Western Australian patients aged above 65 years admitted for HF between 2003 and 2008 in the linked Hospital Morbidity Data Collection. Taking into consideration the class imbalance problem, we developed a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based approach to predict 30 day HF readmission or death and compared the predictive performances using the performance metrics, that is, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), area under the precision–recall curve (AUPRC), sensitivity and specificity with other ML and regression models. Out of the 10 757 patients with HF, 23.6% were readmitted or died within 30 days of hospital discharge. We observed an AUC of 0.55, 0.53, 0.58, and 0.54 while an AUPRC of 0.39, 0.38, 0.46, and 0.38 for weighted random forest, weighted decision trees, logistic regression, and weighted support vector machines models, respectively. The MLP-based approach produced the highest AUC (0.62) and AUPRC (0.46) with 48% sensitivity and 70% specificity. Conclusions: We show that for the medical data with class imbalance, the proposed MLP-based approach is superior to other ML and regression techniques for the prediction of 30 day HF readmission or death. © 2019 The Authors.

In addition, the traditional difference map generated by log-ratio is subject to the speckle, which will reduce the accuracy. In this letter, an imbalanced learning-based change detection is proposed based on PCA network (PCA-Net), where a supervised PCA-Net is designed to obtain the robust features directly from given multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images instead of a difference map. Furthermore, to tackle with the imbalance between changed and unchanged classes, we propose a morphologically supervised learning method, where the knowledge in the pixels near the boundary between two classes is exploited to guide network training. Finally, our proposed PCA-Net can be trained by the data sets with available reference maps and applied to a new data set, which is quite practical in change detection projects. Our proposed method is verified on five sets of multiple temporal SAR images. It is demonstrated from the experiment results that with the knowledge in training samples from the boundary, the learned features benefit change detection and make the proposed method outperform than supervised methods trained by randomly drawing samples. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","Change detection; imbalance learning; PCA network (PCA-Net); synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Many researchers have proposed various intrusion detection systems using machine learning (ML) methods. However, there are two noteworthy factors affecting the robustness of the model. One is the severe imbalance of network traffic in different categories and the other is the nonidentical distribution between training set and test set in feature space. This paper presents a multilevel intrusion detection model framework named multilevel semi-supervised ML (MSML) to address these issues. The MSML framework includes four modules: 1) pure cluster extraction; 2) pattern discovery; 3) fine-grained classification (FC); and 4) model updating. In the pure cluster module, we introduce an concept of 'pure cluster' and propose a hierarchical semi-supervised k-means algorithm with an aim to find out all the pure clusters. In the pattern discovery module, we define the 'unknown pattern' and apply cluster-based method aiming to find those unknown patterns. Then a test sample is sentenced to labeled known pattern or unlabeled unknown pattern. The FC module can achieves FC for those unknown pattern samples. The model updating module provides a mechanism for retraining. KDDCUP99 dataset is applied to evaluate MSML. Experimental results show that MSML is superior to other existing intrusion detection models in terms of overall accuracy, F1-score, and unknown pattern recognition capability. © 2014 IEEE.","Class imbalance; intrusion detection; nonidentical distribution; semi-supervised learning; unknown pattern discovery","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, several previous studies have indicated that the performance of active learning is easily disrupted by an imbalanced data distribution. Some existing imbalanced active learning approaches also suffer from either low performance or high time consumption. To address these problems, this paper describes an efficient solution based on the extreme learning machine (ELM) classification model, called active online-weighted ELM (AOW-ELM). The main contributions of this paper include: 1) the reasons why active learning can be disrupted by an imbalanced instance distribution and its influencing factors are discussed in detail; 2) the hierarchical clustering technique is adopted to select initially labeled instances in order to avoid the missed cluster effect and cold start phenomenon as much as possible; 3) the weighted ELM (WELM) is selected as the base classifier to guarantee the impartiality of instance selection in the procedure of active learning, and an efficient online updated mode of WELM is deduced in theory; and 4) an early stopping criterion that is similar to but more flexible than the margin exhaustion criterion is presented. The experimental results on 32 binary-class data sets with different imbalance ratios demonstrate that the proposed AOW-ELM algorithm is more effective and efficient than several state-of-the-art active learning algorithms that are specifically designed for the class imbalance scenario. © 2018 IEEE.","Active learning; class imbalance; cost-sensitive learning; extreme learning machine (ELM); online learning; stopping criterion","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

First, based on a fast classifier extreme learning machine (ELM), fuzzy membership of sample is proposed in order to eliminate classification error coming from noise and outlier samples, and balance factor is introduced in combination with sample distribution and sample number associated with class to alleviate the bias against performance caused by imbalanced data. Furthermore, ensemble of ELMs is used for making classification performance more stable and accurate. A number of base ELMs are removed based on dissimilarity measure, and the remaining base ELMs are integrated by majority voting.

However, the split criterion used for constructing a customized tree in LazyDT is information gain, which is skew-sensitive.

In this work, we explore anomaly detection methods as a method for mitigating class imbalance for depression detection. Our approach adopts a multi-stage machine learning pipeline. First, using autoen-coders, we project the mobility features of the majority class (undepressed users). Thereafter, the trained autoencoder then classifies a test set of users as either depressed (anomalous) or not depressed (inliers) using a One Class SVM algorithm. Our method, when applied to the real-world StudentLife data set shows that even with an extremely imbalanced dataset, our method is able to detect individuals with depression symptoms with an AUC-ROC of 0.92, significantly outperforming traditional machine learning classification approaches. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

It affects the performance of machine learning algorithms by allowing them to show bias towards the majority class. This occurs because of the sub-concepts from the minority class. Recent studies has further divided the minority class into four sub-concepts: Safe, Borderline, Rare and Outlier using the majority-minority proportion at the neighborhood of every minority sample. Among the sub-concepts safe are easy to identify and classifiers are increasing inaccurate while classifying other subsequent sub-categories (Boarderline, Rare, Outlier). In some recent studies, heterogeneous value difference metric is used as the distance calculation mechanism for categorizing data. However, there are numerous other distance metrics whose effects on determining the sub-concepts are not explored yet. This research aimed at evaluating the effects of different distance metrics in the calculation of different sub-concepts within the minority class data. We have considered ten datasets and five distance metrics for the calculation. The datasets are divided into three categories: all categorical, mixed and fully numeric data. For the datasets with more categorical data outputs hugely differs between the distance functions. In those cases, relatively safer examples are calculated by the Euclidean and the Manhattan distance function. Our study shows that for categorizing minority data distance metrics should be chosen dataset wise. © 2018 IEEE.","Chebyshev; Euclidean; HOEM; HVDM; Imbalance Data; Machine Learning; Manhattan; Outlier etc; Rare","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

High-throughput omics data in the form of molecular profile matrices, such as transcriptomes and metabolomes, have long existed as a valuable resource for facilitating diagnosis of patient statuses/stages. It is timely imperative to compare deep learning neural networks against classical machine learning methods in the setting of matrix-formed omics data in terms of classification accuracy and robustness. Results: Using 37 high throughput omics datasets, covering transcriptomes and metabolomes, we evaluated the classification power of deep learning compared to traditional machine learning methods. Representative deep learning methods, Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), were deployed and explored in seeking optimal architectures for the best classification performance. Together with five classical supervised classification methods (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Multinomial Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine), MLP and CNN were comparatively tested on the 37 datasets to predict disease stages or to discriminate diseased samples from normal samples. MLPs achieved the highest overall accuracy among all methods tested. More thorough analyses revealed that single hidden layer MLPs with ample hidden units outperformed deeper MLPs. Furthermore, MLP was one of the most robust methods against imbalanced class composition and inaccurate class labels. Conclusion: Our results concluded that shallow MLPs (of one or two hidden layers) with ample hidden neurons are sufficient to achieve superior and robust classification performance in exploiting numerical matrix-formed omics data for diagnosis purpose. Specific observations regarding optimal network width, class imbalance tolerance, and inaccurate labeling tolerance will inform future improvement of neural network applications on functional genomics data. © 2019 The Author(s).","Artificial neural network; Cancer diagnosis; Deep learning; Omics; Supervised classification","BioMed Central Ltd."

The code smell prediction using source code metrics can be used in starting phases of software development life cycle to reduce the maintenance and testing effort of software and also help in improving the quality of the software. The work in this paper empirically investigates and evaluates different classification techniques, feature selection techniques, and data sampling techniques to handle imbalance data in predicting 7 different types of code smell.

Existing clinical decision support systems often apply statistical machine learning methods to construct disease prediction models with the collected clinical records as training data sets and the clinical manifestation texts as feature spaces, which can help diagnose patient disease. In medical field, the common human diseases usually have much more clinical records than the rare diseases which only have few recorded samples. The imbalance of diseases samples often has a bad effect on the model's prediction effect. Under-sampling is a common method that combines the part samples extracted from majority samples and the minority samples into a balanced dataset. The existing under-sampling methods can significantly improve the recall rate of the model while it also usually leads to the decrease of the model's accuracy at the same time, which limits the overall promotion effect of the prediction model. To address this, in this paper, we propose a new ensemble classification method based on under-sampling with iteratively boosting (USIB). The method uses a boosting method to iteratively build a set of weaker classifiers by under-sampling the majority class samples, and ensemble these weaker classifiers to a strong classifier in order to improve the effect of prediction model for single disease under imbalanced data set. Besides, the medical data sets always have multiple classes and a sample has several labels. Thus, to meet the diagnosis of multiple diseases and complications in clinical significance, we combined the single disease prediction models into a multi-label disease prediction model. In order to further improve the effect of multi-label prediction model, we designed a Label Selection method based on label Maximum Mutual Information Spanning Tree (LS-MMIST). The method builds the maximum mutual information spanning tree between labels according to the distribution of the original data set and determines the final labels by the relation between the disease labels in the tree when predicting an unknown multi-label clinical sample. In experiment, we first evaluated the predictive performance of our ensemble method based on under-sampling with iteratively boosting under the imbalanced data set by using three different open imbalanced binary data sets and four private rare diseases data sets. In detail, the proposed under-sampling method with iteratively boosting improves the average of F1 value by 22.58% on various imbalanced binary classification data sets. Secondly, we compared the performance of the proposed multi-label prediction model with the existing multi-label prediction techniques on Traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine data sets. The experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the current eight mainstream under-sampling and two kinds of ensemble sampling methods in imbalanced medical data sets especially in classes of small sample size. And compared with the existing multi-label prediction technology, our multi-label disease prediction model increased the precision rate by 6.30% and 12.43%, the recall rate by 4.33% and 5.86%, the F1 value by 5.48% and 11.16% respectively. In addition, compared with a LSTM model, our multi-label disease prediction model is more applicable to a small-size sample set. © 2019, Science Press.

Among the several fault diagnosis approaches, knowledge-based fault diagnosis, which uses signals from sensors and machine learning algorithms instead of a priori information, is widely employed to diagnose the status of products. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based procedure to establish a fault diagnosis model. The model is aimed to diagnose planetary gear carrier packs, which have many fault types and an unbalanced number of samples in the sample classes, using transmission error. In the procedure, the best feature subset that contains the most important features is selected using two different feature selection processes. Several ensemble algorithms are used during the model training process. The imbalance ratio between classes of samples is addressed. The number of weak learners is automatically determined by a genetic algorithm. Finally, the performance of the proposed procedure is validated by comparison with other models trained without applying the proposed procedure. We observed that it is important to incorporate the class imbalance technique in the training process as it reduces the misclassification of faulty products as normal ones.

Although, great success has been achieved by the prevailing data engineering and mining techniques, the problem of swift classification of the imbalanced data still exists in academia and industry. A potential solution to the problem of skewness in data can be resolved by data upsampling or downsampling. There exists a few techniques that firstly remove skewness and then perform classification, however, these methods suffer from hurdles like abortive precision or slower learning rate. In this paper, a hybrid method to classify binary imbalanced data using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique followed by Extreme Learning Machine is proposed.

Detecting outliers in the trajectory is critical to improving data quality and the accuracy of subsequent trajectory data mining tasks. In this paper, we propose a trajectory outlier detection algorithm based on a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model. First, a six-dimensional motion feature vector is extracted for each trajectory point, and then we construct a Bi-LSTM model. The model input is the trajectory data feature vector of a certain sequence length, and its output is the class type of the current track point. In addition, a combination method of undersampling and oversampling is applied to mitigate the effect of data distribution imbalance on detection performance. The Bi-LSTM model can automatically learn the difference between the normal points and adjacent abnormal points in the motion characteristics by combining the LSTM unit and the bidirectional network. Experimental results based on a real ship trajectory annotation data show that the detection performance of our proposed algorithm significantly exceeds those of the constant velocity threshold algorithm, non-sequential classical machine learning classification algorithms, and convolutional neural network model.

The development of clinical decision support systems analyzing patients’ data in real time offers an opportunity to fill this gap. Objective The objective of this study was to determine whether a machine learning predictive model could be trained on a set of clinical data and used to predict transcutaneous hemoglobin oxygen saturation 5 min (5min SpO2) after a ventilator setting change. Data sources Data of mechanically ventilated children admitted between May 2015 and April 2017 were included and extracted from a high-resolution research database. More than 776,727 data rows were obtained from 610 patients, discretized into 3 class labels (&lt; 84%, 85% to 91% and c92% to 100%). Performance metrics of predictive models Due to data imbalance, four different data balancing processes were applied. Then, two machine learning models (artificial neural network and Bootstrap aggregation of complex decision trees) were trained and tested on these four different balanced datasets. The best model predicted SpO2 with area under the curves &lt; 0.75. Conclusion This single center pilot study using machine learning predictive model resulted in an algorithm with poor accuracy. The comparison of machine learning models showed that bagged complex trees was a promising approach. However, there is a need to improve these models before incorporating them into a clinical decision support systems. One potentially solution for improving predictive model, would be to increase the amount of data available to limit over-fitting that is potentially one of the cause for poor classification performances for 2 of the three class labels. © 2019 Ghazal et al.

Effective prediction enables reasonable testing resource allocation, which eventually leads to a more reliable software. Objective: The complex structures and the imbalanced class distribution in software defect data make it challenging to obtain suitable data features and learn an effective defect prediction model. In this paper, we propose a method to address these two challenges. Method: We propose a defect prediction framework called KPWE that combines two techniques, i.e., Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (WELM). Our framework consists of two major stages. In the first stage, KPWE aims to extract representative data features. It leverages the KPCA technique to project the original data into a latent feature space by nonlinear mapping. In the second stage, KPWE aims to alleviate the class imbalance. It exploits the WELM technique to learn an effective defect prediction model with a weighting-based scheme. Results: We have conducted extensive experiments on 34 projects from the PROMISE dataset and 10 projects from the NASA dataset. The experimental results show that KPWE achieves promising performance compared with 41 baseline methods, including seven basic classifiers with KPCA, five variants of KPWE, eight representative feature selection methods with WELM, 21 imbalanced learning methods. Conclusion: In this paper, we propose KPWE, a new software defect prediction framework that considers the feature extraction and class imbalance issues. The empirical study on 44 software projects indicate that KPWE is superior to the baseline methods in most cases. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Feature extraction; Kernel principal component analysis; Nonlinear mapping; Weighted extreme learning machine","Elsevier B.V."

First, a geometry-based partitioning method is modified for imbalanced datasets to divide the input space into multiple linearly separable partitions along the potential separation boundary. Then an F-score-based method is applied to obtain local offsets optimized on each local cluster. Finally, by constructing a quasi-linear kernel based on the partitioning information, a quasi-linear SVM classifier with local offsets is constructed for the imbalanced datasets.

Class imbalance problems are seen increasingly in many domains and pose a challenge to traditional classification techniques. Learning from imbalanced data (two or more classes) creates additional complexities. Studies suggest that ensemble methods can produce more accurate results than regular Imbalance learning techniques (sampling and cost-sensitive learning). To deal with the problem, we propose a new hybrid under sampling based ensemble approach (HUSBoost) to handle imbalanced data which includes three basic steps- data cleaning, data balancing and classification steps. At first, we remove the noisy data using Tomek-Links. After that we create several balanced subsets by applying random under sampling (RUS) method to the majority class instances. These under sampled majority class instances and the minority class instances constitute the subsets of the imbalanced data-set. Having the same number of majority and minority class instances, they become balanced subsets of data. Then in each balanced subset, random forest (RF), AdaBoost with decision tree (CART) and AdaBoost with Support Vector Machine (SVM) are implemented in parallel where we use soft voting approach to get the combined result. From these ensemble classifiers we get the average result from all the balanced subsets.

There are two key issues for the downsampling processing based imbalanced data classification. One is how to maximize the mining of minority type of information from the data set with absolute dominance of several types. The second one is how to ensure that the learner is built without excessive loss of most types of information. A simple and effective strategy is to conduct the downsampling on the majority class. The existing methods usually suffer from losing the information or destroying the intrinsic structure of the original data set. In this paper, we propose a new imbalanced data ensemble classification method with the aid of stratified sampling on majority class (EC-SS). To mine the hidden structure in majority class sufficiently, an adaptive self-tuning clustering strategy is adopted to separate the major-class samples into different strata and then the stratified sampling is used to under-sample the majority class. This strategy works well to generate the data components for subsequent ensemble learning, and its main advantage is to keep the data structure of the original data set. A series of experiments on the real benchmark datasets Musk1, Ecoli3, Glass2, and Yeast6, show that the proposed EC-SS outperforms the baselines of ensemble classification based on random sampling (EC-RS), adaptive sampling with optimal cost for class-imbalance learning (AdaS), kernel based adaptive synthetic data generation (KernelADASYN) and cost-sensitive large margin distribution machine (CS-LDM). © 2019 Science Press.

This is particularly important when the data has class-imbalance problems. Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) has been commonly used by the machine learning community in such situations, and recently researchers are starting to use Matthew Correlation Coefficient (MCC), especially in biomedical research. However, there is no empirical study that has been conducted to compare the suitability of the two metrics. In this paper, the aim of this study is to provide insights about how AUC and MCC are compared to each other when used with classical machine learning algorithms over a range of imbalanced datasets. In our study, we utilize an earlierproposed criteria for comparing metrics based on the degree of consistency and degree of Discriminancy to compare AUC against MCC. We carry out experiments using four machine learning algorithms on 54 imbalanced datasets, with imbalance ratios ranging from 1%to 10%. The results demonstrate that both AUC and MCC are statistically consistent with each other; however AUC is more discriminating than MCC. The same observation is noticed when evaluated on 23 balanced datasets. This suggests AUC to be a better measure than MCC in evaluating and comparing classification algorithms. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Area under curve; Consistency; Decision tree; Discriminancy; Indifferency; K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning; Matthew correlation coefficient; Random forest; Support vector machines","Association for Computing Machinery"

As a result, these communities have looked to leverage recent advances in machine learning algorithms. This class of algorithms are able to find hidden patterns and develop new knowledge in complex data, accelerating the rate of discovery in multiple research domains. In this paper, we present our methodology of applying machine learning algorithms to health outcomes, chemical exposures, and social behavior data from expectant mothers, as part of the NIEHS-supported PROTECT Center. The ultimate goal is to determine the dominant factors/features potentially responsible for the high rate of premature births in Puerto Rico.Many commonly-used machine learning algorithms can be used for feature selection. However, given the imbalance in our birth outcome data, with many more term (i.e., 37 weeks or longer) versus preterm pregnancies (i.e., less than 37 weeks), analysis of the PROTECT dataset presents many unique challenges. In addition to outcome imbalance, our database contains both quantitative and categorical data variables, adding some complexity to the analytical methods used. Applying straightforward correlation or regression analysis would be insufficient. Our datasets also contain a significant amount of missing data (incomplete records), providing noisy input to our algorithms. A further challenge is that we are working with a relatively limited set of complex data (only 2000 participants to date), so our models must be able to be built with a relatively small number of data samples.To overcome these challenges, we have implemented a cus-tomized end-to-end analytical toolchain which forms a pre-processing pipeline. Our framework performs general data filtering and handles missing data fields using a similarity-based approach. Next, we apply one of a number of different machine learning algorithms, including Linear Correlation, Normalized Mutual Information, Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees. We use these during both feature selection and model performance evaluation. Finally, we present top-ranked features produced by our model as potential key contributors of high preterm birth rates in Puerto Rico, and discuss results across these algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Classification is one of the supervised learning models that is applied in medical domains. Achieving better performance on real data that contains imbalance characteristics is a very challenging task. Machine learning researchers have been using various techniques to obtain higher accuracy, generally by correctly identifying majority class samples while ignoring the instances of the minority class. However, in most of the cases the concept of the minority class instances usually is of higher interest than the majority class. In this research, we applied three different classification techniques on a real world breast cancer risk factors data set. First, we applied specified classification techniques on breast cancer data without applying any resampling technique. Second, since the data is imbalanced meaning data has an unequal distribution between the classes, we applied several resampling methods to get better performance before applying the classifiers. The experimental results show significant improvement on using a resampling method as compared to applying no resampling technique, particularly for the minority class. © 2018 IEEE.","Breast cancer; Class imbalance; Classification; Risk factors","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Moreover, CNNs are capable of identifying substances from noisy spectra without the need for additional preprocessing. However, their application in practical spectroscopy is restricted due to two reasons. First the effectiveness of classification using CNNs diminishes rapidly when only a small number of spectra per substance are available for training (which is a typical situation in real applications). Secondly, to accommodate new, previously unseen, substance classes the network must be retrained which is computationally intensive. Here we address these issues by reformulating a multi-class classification problem with a large number of classes to a binary classification problem for which the available data is sufficient for representation learning. Hence, we define the learning task as identifying pairs of inputs as belonging to the same class or different classes. We achieve this using a Siamese convolutional neural network. A novel sampling strategy is proposed to address the imbalance problem in training the Siamese network. The trained network can classify samples of previously unseen substance classes using just a single reference sample (termed as one-shot learning in the machine learning community). Our results on three independent Raman datasets demonstrate much better accuracy than other practical systems to date, while allowing effortless updates of the system's database with new substance classes. © 2018","Convolutional neural networks; One-shot learning; Siamese network; Spectrum matching","Elsevier B.V."

It addresses the problem of diagnosis, surgery, anatomy, disease progress, analysis, and teaching purposes in medicine. There are many patients have many diseases at the same time, maybe in the same organ, such as ocular diseases. On the other side, the multilabel classification is a challenging issue by nature.

Challenges in this area include class imbalance due to high manufacturing yield, and concept drift due to the time-varying environment. We present batch and online learning methods to tackle the imbalanced classification problem, and incremental machine learning frameworks to overcome concept drift. We consider the packaging and testing process in chip stack flash memory manufacturing as an application. By testing our methods on real data from industry, we show the possibility of packaged memory yield improvement with machine learning-based classifiers detecting bad dies before packaging. Experimental results show significant yield improvement potential. In a time-invariant environment, for stacks of eight dies, we can achieve an approximately 9% yield improvement. In a longer period of time with realistic concept drift, a naive approach using a fixed false alarm rate-based decision boundary is shown to fail to improve yield.

In order to overcome these limitations, this chapter proposes a model that consists of an initial preprocessing step, which is followed by an attributes selection step, after which classification is achieved using association rule mining. This proposed model gives the appropriate direction for future research on early diagnosis of AD and has the potential to distinguish AD from healthy controls. © 2020 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"CRC Press"

Accurate assessment of this risk is crucial to their course of care. We focus on estimating a patient's risk of cardiovascular death after an acute coronary syndrome based on a patient's raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signal. Learning from this signal is challenging for two reasons: 1) positive examples signifying a downstream cardiovascular event are scarce, causing drastic class imbalance, and 2) each patient's ECG signal consists of thousands of heartbeats, accompanied by a single label for the downstream outcome. Machine learning has been previously applied to this task, but most approaches rely on hand-crafted features and domain knowledge. We propose a method that learns a representation from the raw ECG signal by using a multiple instance learning framework. We present a learned risk score for cardiovascular death that outperforms existing risk metrics in predicting cardiovascular death within 30, 60, 90, and 365 days on a dataset of 5000 patients. © 2018 D.

Fast-growing biomedical and healthcare data have encompassed multiple scales ranging from molecules, cells, and individuals to populations, and have connected various entities in healthcare systems such as providers, pharma, and payers with increasing bandwidth, depth, and resolution. These data are becoming an enabling resource to harness for scientific knowledge discovery and clinical decision making. Meanwhile, the sheer volume and complexity of the data present major barriers toward their translation into effective clinical actions. In particular, biomedical data often feature large volumes, high dimensions, imbalance between classes, heterogeneous sources, noises, incompleteness, and rich contexts, which challenges the direct and immediate success of existing machine learning and optimization methods. For instance, deep learning methods have made notable advances for biomedical informatics needs, especially in processing brain-imaging data and making neuroscience discovery, although their utilities to more types of data in more biomedical informatics use-cases still awaits further assessment and development.

The two core building blocks, diversity and combination rule, which play a significant role in ensemble learners. The ensemble approach can be divided into two broad groups based on the variation of base classifiers: homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble. We conducted a comprehensive review of the ensemble learning used for data analytics. The study has proceeded from the feature selection to classification. We found that the ensemble learning helps to overcome the problem associated with the dimensionality and class imbalance of data. For this reason, the ensemble approach found to be more suitable for the classification of high-dimensional data. Then we move towards the meta-analytics using ensemble learning. Our comprehensive review of the metaheuristics-based ensemble learning for homogeneous and heterogeneous ensemble found a substantial number of applications of ensemble learning from these categories. The in detail study of the ensemble learning in business applications able to identify four successful application areas: purchasing and marketing, predictive analytics, business process management, and customer churn prediction.

Nevertheless, most ML classification algorithms accuracy is reduced when the classes to be classified are not represented equally in the dataset i.e. the problem of imbalance. In this paper, we compare the performance of five machine learning classification algorithms using an imbalanced data set where two facies types dominate the dataset. model selection is carried out first then algorithms are compared using cross-validation concept and finally best performing models are investigated further and compared in terms of prediction accuracy using the same data set.

Numerous techniques for coping with such imbalances have been proposed, but nearly all lack any theoretical grounding. By contrast, the standard theoretical analysis of machine learning admits no dependence on the imbalance of classes at all. The basic theorems of statistical learning establish the number of examples needed to estimate the accuracy of a classifier as a function of its complexity (VC-dimension) and the confidence desired; the class imbalance does not enter these formulas anywhere. In this work, we consider the measures of classifier performance in terms of precision and recall, a measure that is widely suggested as more appropriate to the classification of imbalanced data. We observe that whenever the precision is moderately large, the worse of the precision and recall is within a small constant factor of the accuracy weighted by the class imbalance. A corollary of this observation is that a larger number of examples is necessary and sufficient to address class imbalance, a finding we also illustrate empirically. © 2019, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Whenever shale formations exhibit a geological heterogeneity, the distribution and magnitude of the associated geomechanical heterogeneity can significantly impact fracture propagation and result in fracture barriers or baffles that negatively impact the SRV. It is essential to adapt well targeting, hydraulic fracture design and well spacing to these heterogeneities to optimize the SRV. In this case study, such mechanically heterogeneous beds within the reservoir (resulting from geologic variability) were identified through core analysis and measurements. These heterogeneities did not have a clear interpretable log signature so it was difficult to locate, map, and assess their distribution across the play using well logs prior to applying the methods described in this paper. Methods/procedure/process: The method discussed in this paper consists of designing a machine learning predictive model that after training on 9 cored wells, was able to predict the distribution and thickness of the geomechanical heterogeneities across the play using roughly 100 vertical wells with triple combo logs. Beyond the classic methodology of machine learning, today considered a conventional technology, this paper presents the key steps of data processing that significantly improved prediction accuracy, and focuses on explaining why most of those steps are likely to be useful for a variety of analogous geological machine learning workflows. The workflow included: 1- an original transformation of the raw logs into engineered features based on a proper understanding of the impact of the heterogeneities on the behavior of each log; 2- a decomposition of the classification model into multiple stages, to integrate geological expertise and boost some critical algorithmic elements (in particular through class imbalance correction and bias-variance optimization); 3- an advanced management of cross-validation and exploitation of genetic searching, to optimize model robustness with a relatively small input dataset. Results/observations/conclusions: Excellent prediction accuracy based on cross-validation was confirmed by a remarkable geological/geographical consistency of the results, once prediction results were converted into maps. The continuity of deposits and orientations of the sediment supply were in line with known basin paleogeography. This paper defines a comprehensive approach of machine learning applied to electrofacies, and beyond the direct results of the study, it highlights how data science methods benefit from in-depth integration of geological interpretation.

CDS systems can be based on existing guidelines or best practices; and can also utilize machine learning to provide a diagnosis, recommendation, or therapy course. Methods: This research aimed to identify evidence-based study designs and outcome measures to determine the clinical effectiveness of clinical decision support systems in the detection and prediction of hemodynamic instability, respiratory distress, and infection within critical care settings. PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews were systematically searched to identify primary research published in English between 2013 and 2018. Studies conducted in the USA, Canada, UK, Germany and France with more than 10 participants per arm were included. Results: In studies on hemodynamic instability, the prediction and management of septic shock were the most researched topics followed by the early prediction of heart failure. For respiratory distress, the most popular topics were pneumonia detection and prediction followed by pulmonary embolisms. Given the importance of imaging and clinical notes, this area combined Machine Learning with image analysis and natural language processing. In studies on infection, the most researched areas were the detection, prediction, and management of sepsis, surgical site infections, as well as acute kidney injury. Overall, a variety of Machine Learning algorithms were utilized frequently, particularly support vector machines, boosting techniques, random forest classifiers and neural networks. Sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC were the most frequently reported performance measures. Conclusion: This review showed an increasing use of Machine Learning for CDS in all three areas. Large datasets are required for training these algorithms; making it imperative to appropriately address, challenges such as class imbalance, correct labelling of data and missing data. Recommendations are formulated for the development and successful adoption of CDS systems. © 2019 Medic G et al.","Clinical trials; Critical care; Hemodynamic instability; Infection; Machine learning; Respiratory distress; Sepsis","F1000 Research Ltd"

The idea of planets existing other than Earth which could possibly harbor life has intrigued and captured the imagination of scientists for centuries. In the last decade, thousands of planets were discovered in our own Galaxy. This led to the inference that stars with planets are a usual occurrence, and the estimates of the actual number of planets exceeds the number of stars by orders of magnitude. Led by the NASA Kepler Mission, the planetary searches yielded nearly 7000 confirmed and yet to be confirmed exoplanets. The discovery and characterization of exoplanets require both extremely accurate instrumentation and sophisticated statistical methods in order to extract the weak planetary signals. We propose a new model,”Constant Elasticity Earth Similarity Approach” (CEESA) to quantify habitability and match the”Earth similarity approach” to classification schemes of extrasolar planets via deep learning architecture. The data used for the analysis is taken from Planetary Habitability Laboratory's Habitable Exoplanets Catalog (HEC). The catalog exhibits significant imbalance, which are dealt with in a twofold manner for the task of classification: first, by iterative artificial balancing, and second, by artificial data augmentation. In either case, the efficacy of classification algorithms are analyzed and related to the structure and distribution of the data. The CEESA model is based on CES production function and is represented as follows Y = f(R, D, Ts, Ve, E) = (r.R? + d.D? + t.Ts? + v.Ve? + e.E?) ? ? where, R is radius, D is density, Ts is surface temperature, Ve is escape velocity and E is the eccentricity of an exoplanet. r, d, t, v, and e are the corresponding coefficients of those parameters and lie in (0, 1). Y is the target output; The range of ? and ? values are within 0-1. We develop a tool for planetary habitability using the functional form combined with planetary features to generate a class predictor. Both approaches produce a similar outcome. The complexity of the functional form presents a challenge in terms of finding the optimum habitability score. The habitability computation problem is rewritten as a constrained optimization exercise and the difficulty is mitigated by Particle Swarm optimization based approach. The classification method used here draws advantages from deep neural network and some disruptive interventions in deep nets to reduce computational complexity and ensure class-wise accuracy. The exoplanets are classified into Mesoplanets, Psychroplanets and non-habitable planets. The accuracy of the classifier is above 95% consistently under several test cases. The strength of the proposed method lies in bringing together”earth similarity” and”planetary classification” approaches for a more meaningful interpretation of habitability.

Semi-supervised learning techniques enhance training data by combining labelled and unlabelled data. However, existing approaches have skewed classification of unlabelled data towards labelled data despite class imbalance of labelled data and unmatched feature distribution between labelled and testing data, that is common in abusive texts. This paper presents a reliable semi-supervised learning approach that reduces the noise in training data by combining features of unlabelled data with varying sizes of important features of labelled data.

The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) is a well-known preprocessing approach for handling imbalanced datasets, where the minority class is over-sampled by producing synthetic examples in feature vector rather than data space. However, many recent works have shown that the imbalanced ratio in itself is not a problem and deterioration of the model performance is caused by other reasons linked to the minority class sample distribution. The blind oversampling by SMOTE leads to two major problems: noise and borderline examples. Noisy examples are those from one class located in the safe zone of the other. Borderline examples are those located in the neighborhood of the class boundary. These samples are associated with deteriorating performance of the models developed. Therefore, it is critical to concentrate on the minority class data structure and regulate the positioning of the newly introduced minority class samples for better performance of classifiers. Hence, this paper proposes the advanced SMOTE, denoted as A-SMOTE, to adjust the newly introduced minority class examples based on distance to the original minority class samples. To achieve this objective, we first employ the SMOTE algorithm to introduce new samples to the minority and eliminate those examples that are closer to the majority than the minority. We apply the proposed method to 44 datasets at various imbalance ratios. Ten widely used data sampling methods selected from the literature are employed for performance comparison. The C4.5 and Naive Bayes classifiers are utilized for experimental validation. The results confirm the advantage of the proposed method over the other methods in almost all the datasets and illustrate its suitability for data preprocessing in classification tasks. © 2019 The Authors.

However, when dealing with the real world data, we encounter three problems such as 1) missing data, 2) class imbalance, and 3) missing label problems. These problems undermine the performance of a classifier. Various preprocessing techniques have been proposed to mitigate one of these problems, but an algorithm that assumes and resolves all three problems together has not been proposed yet. In this paper, we propose HexaGAN, a generative adversarial network framework that shows promising classification performance for all three problems. We interpret the three problems from a single perspective to solve them jointly. To enable this, the framework consists of six components, which interact with each other. We also devise novel loss functions corresponding to the architecture. The designed loss functions allow us to achieve state-of-the-art imputation performance, with up to a 14% improvement, and to generate high-quality class-conditional data. We evaluate the classification performance (F1 -score) of the proposed method with 20% missingness and confirm up to a 5% improvement in comparison with the performance of combinations of state-of-the-art methods. © 36th International Conference on Machine Learning, ICML 2019.

However, real life data is hardly ever found balanced, rather skewed data is the common occurrence. This poses some serious challenges to the standard techniques of classification and regression. The performance and effectiveness of these techniques are substantially affected by overfitting, creating a bias towards the majority class. In recent years, quite a few number of methods have been introduced for classification of imbalanced data. But most of them are designed for binary classes and it is difficult or inefficient to extend them for multiple classes. Moreover, data imbalance problem occurs frequently in regression analysis too, with only a handful of algorithms robust enough to tackle to this problem. In this paper, we propose an effective recursive method for multi-class classification with imbalanced data. Our proposed algorithm partitions and balances the data, and is applied recursively coupled with ensemble techniques.

While the effect of importance weighting is well-characterized for low-capacity misspecified models, little is known about how it impacts over-parameterized, deep neural networks. Inspired by recent theoretical results showing that on (linearly) separable data, deep linear networks optimized by SGD learn weight-agnostic solutions, we ask, for realistic deep networks, for which many practical dataseis are separable, what is the effect of importance weighting? We present the surprising finding that while importance weighting impacts deep nets early in training, so long as the nets are able to separate the training data, its effect diminishes over successive epochs. Moreover, while L2 regularization and batch normalization (but not dropout), restore some of the impact of importance weighting, they express the effect via (seemingly) the wrong abstraction: why should practitioners tweak the L2 regularization, and by how much, to produce the correct weighting effect?

However, traditional SVM making use of Hinge Loss cannot deal with class imbalance problems, because it applies the same weight of loss to each class. Recently, Focal Loss has been widely used for deep learning to address the imbalanced datasets. The significant effectiveness of Focal loss attracts the attention in many fields, such as object detection, semantic segmentation. Inspired by Focal loss, we reconstructed Hinge Loss with the scaling factor of Focal loss, called FH Loss, which not only deals with the class imbalance problems but also preserve the distinctive property of Hinge loss. Owing to the difficulty of the trade-off between positive and negative accuracy in imbalanced classification, FH loss pays more attention on minority class and misclassified instances to improve the accuracy of each class, further to reduce the influence of imbalance. In addition, due to the difficulty of solving SVM with FH loss, we propose an improved model with modified FH loss, called Adaptive FH-SVM. The algorithm solves the optimization problem iteratively and adaptively updates the FH loss of each instance.

In data mining algorithms, imbalanced data is a profound problem in machine learning paradigm. It appears due to desperate nature of data in which, one class with a large number of instances presents the majority class, while the other class with only a few instances is known as minority class. The classifier model biases towards the majority class and neglects the minority class which may happen to be the most essential class; resulting into costly misclassification error of minority class in real-world scenarios. Imbalanced data problem is significantly overcome by using re-sampling techniques, in which oversampling techniques are proven to be more effective than undersampling. This study proposes an Improved Adaptive Semi Unsupervised Weighted Oversampling (IA-SUWO) technique with sparsity factor, which efficiently solves between-the-class and within-the-class imbalances problem. Along with avoiding over-generalization, overfitting problems and removing noise from the data, this technique enhances the number of synthetic instances in the minority sub-clusters appropriately.

However, many financial corporations still depend on operators to identify and eliminate the system failures when financial IT systems break down. This traditional operation method is time consuming and extremely inefficient. To improve the efficiency and accuracy of system failure detection and thereby reduce the impact of system failures on financial services, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to predict the occurrence of system exceptions and failures in a financial IT system. In particular, we first extract rich information from system logs and eliminate noises in the data. Then the cleaned data is leveraged as the input of our proposed anomaly prediction framework which consists of three modules: key performance indicator data prediction module, anomaly identification module and severity classification module. Notably, we design a hierarchical architecture of alarm classifiers and try to alleviate the influence of class-imbalance problem on the overall performance.

Facies classes are basically based on rock characteristics that can indicate the locations of good quality of sand and presence of hydrocarbon, thereby helping the geologists to decide the location to drill a production well in a hydrocarbon field. However, due to the heterogeneous and nonlinear nature of earth subsurface, gathering facies information becomes a critical task. Researchers from different domains such as Machine learning, Geology, and Geophysics work towards the understanding of facies distribution. However, with the increased complexity of the reservoir, its interpretation becomes difficult. This work describes a case study that involves a framework to classify the facies categories in a reservoir using seismic data by employing different machine learning models. The framework is also capable to handle the data imbalance problem that occurs quite often while studying these kinds of datasets. Moreover, for gaining more confidence in the developed model, we used Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations to provide the interpretation of the model.

Machine-learning-based methods have been widely used for the prediction of protein-ligand binding sites. Nevertheless, the severe class imbalance phenomenon, where the number of nonbinding (majority) residues is far greater than that of binding (minority) residues, has a negative impact on the performance of such machine-learning-based predictors. Materials and Methods: In this study, we aim to relieve the negative impact of class imbalance by Boosting Multiple Granular Support Vector Machines (BGSVM). In BGSVM, each base SVM is trained on a granular training subset consisting of all minority samples and some reasonably selected majority samples. The efficacy of BGSVM for dealing with class imbalance was validated by benchmarking it with several typical imbalance learning algorithms. We further implemented a protein-nucleotide binding site predictor, called BGSVM-NUC, with the BGSVM algorithm.

We perform an extensive experimental analysis using various representations of text data, several classification algorithms and balancing schemes to derive a model that achieves highest performance with respect to metrics such as precision and recall.

The most studied techniques to deal with the class imbalance problem have been Random Over Sampling (ROS), Random Under Sampling (RUS) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), especially in two-class scenarios. However, in the Big Data scale, multi-class imbalance scenarios have not extensively studied yet, and only a few investigations have been performed. In this work, the effectiveness of ROS and SMOTE techniques is analyzed in the Big data multi-class imbalance context. The KDD99 dataset, which is a popular multi-class imbalanced big data set, was used to probe these oversampling techniques, prior to the application of a Deep Learning Multi-Layer Perceptron.

Studies show that MLAs can outperform classical classification techniques. So, MLAs can be useful in the exploration of strategical raw materials like lithium (Li), which is used in consumer electronics and in the green-power industry. The study area of this work is the Fregeneda-Almendra region (between Spain and Portugal), where Li occurs in pegmatites. However, their smaller exposition can be regarded as a problem to the application of remote sensing methods. To overcome this, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were applied to. This study aims at: (i) comparing the performance accuracy in lithological mapping achieved by SVM and by RF; (ii) evaluating the sensitivity of both classifiers to class imbalance and; (iii) compare the results achieved with previously obtained results. For these, the same Level 1-C Sentinel-2 images (October 2017) were used. SVM showed slightly better accuracy, but RF was able to correctly classify a larger number of mapped Li-bearing pegmatites. The performance of the models was not equal for all classes, having all underperformed in some classes. Also, RF was affected by class imbalanced, while SVM prove to be more insensitive. The potential of this kind of approach in Li-exploration was confirmed since both algorithms correctly identified the presence of Li-bearing pegmatites in the three open-pit mines where they outcrop as well in areas where Li-pegmatites were mapped. Also, some of the areas classified as Li-bearing pegmatites are corroborated by the interest areas delimited in previous studies. © 2019 SPIE.","Image Classification; Lithium (Li); Machine learning; Pegmatites; Random Forest (RF); Remote Sensing; Support Vector Machine (SVM)","SPIE"

Recent advances in deep learning have achieved great success in object detection, speech and image recognition. Although deep learning has been applied to the detection of arrhythmia, detection accuracy is limited because of three major issues: 1. Each ECG signal maybe contains more than one-label information; 2. It is hard to classify ECG with different lengths; 3. Data imbalance problem is severe for arrhythmia detection. In this paper, we present a multi-label learning algorithm to address the class imbalance and detection on ECGs with different durations. We utilize Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) and Wasserstein GAN-Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate new positive samples and use two losses to balance the importance between positive samples and negative samples. Moreover, we construct a Squeeze and Excitation-ResNet (SE-ResNet) module for normal rhythm and arrhythmia detection. In order to solve the multi-label classification problem, we train nine different binary classifiers for each category and determine which types of rhythm the ECG signals belong to.

When the task is to segment pathological structures (e.g. lesions, tumors) from patient images, training on a dataset with few samples is very challenging due to the large class imbalance and inter-subject variability. In this paper, we explore how to best leverage a segmentation model that has been pre-trained on a large dataset of patients images with one disease in order to successfully train a deep learning pathology segmentation model for a different disease, for which only a relatively small patient dataset is available. Specifically, we train a UNet model on a large-scale, proprietary, multi-center, multi-scanner Multiple Sclerosis (MS) clinical trial dataset containing over 3500 multi-modal MRI samples with expert-derived lesion labels. We explore several transfer learning approaches to leverage the learned MS model for the task of multi-class brain tumor segmentation on the BraTS 2018 dataset. Our results indicate that adapting and fine-tuning the encoder and decoder of the network trained on the larger MS dataset leads to improvement in brain tumor segmentation when few instances are available.

When trained on limited datasets, a high capacity model, as most leading neural network architectures are, is likely to overfit and thus generalize poorly to unseen data. Further aggravating the problem, data used to train models in medicine are typically collected in silos and from narrow data distributions that are determined by specific acquisition hardware, imaging protocols, and patient demographics. In addition, class imbalance within and across datasets is a common complication as disease conditions or sub-types have varying degrees of prevalence. In this paper, we motivate the need for generalizable training in the context of skin lesion classification by evaluating the performance of ResNet across 7 public datasets with dataset bias and class imbalance. To mitigate dataset bias, we extend the classification and contrastive semantic alignment (CCSA) loss that aims to learn domain-invariant features. As the CCSA loss requires labelled data from two domains, we propose a strategy to dynamically sample paired data in a setting where the set of available classes varies across domains. To encourage learning from underrepresented classes, the sampled class probabilities are used to weight the classification and alignment losses. Experimental results demonstrate improved generalizability as measured by the mean macro-average recall across the 7 datasets when training using the weighted CCSA loss and dynamic sampler. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"

However, these methods require large labeled datasets that involve resource-intensive expert annotation. Further, disease screening applications have low prevalence of abnormal samples; this class imbalance makes the task more akin to anomaly detection. While the machine learning community has proposed unsupervised deep learning methods for anomaly detection, they have yet to be characterized on medical images where normal vs. anomaly distinctions may be more subtle and variable. In this work, we characterize existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods on retinal fundus images, and find that they require significant fine tuning and offer unsatisfactory performance. We thus propose an efficient and effective transfer-learning based approach for unsupervised anomaly detection. Our method employs a deep convolutional neural network trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor, and subsequently feeds the learned feature representations into an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method. We show that our approach significantly outperforms baselines on two natural image datasets and two retinal fundus image datasets, all with minimal fine-tuning. We further show the ability to leverage very small numbers of labelled anomalies to improve performance. Our work establishes a strong unsupervised baseline for image-based anomaly detection, alongside a flexible and scalable approach for screening applications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Anomaly detection; Retinal images; Transfer learning; Unsupervised deep learning","Springer"

K-means is utilized to select the informative samples near the boundary. During the training phase, the K-means algorithm clusters the majority and minority instances and selects a similar number of instances from each cluster. Boosted C5.0 is then used as the classifier. As there is one different instance selection factor via clustering that encourages the diversity of the training subspace in K-Boosted C5.0, it would be a great advantage to get better performance.

It causes severe damage to financial institutions and individuals. Therefore, the detection and prevention of fraudulent activities are critically important to financial institutions. Fraud detection and prevention are costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive tasks. A number of significant research works have been dedicated to developing innovative solutions to detect different types of fraud. However, these solutions have been proved ineffective. According to Cifa, 33 305 cases of credit card identity fraud were reported between January and June in 2018.1 Various weaknesses of existing solutions have been reported in the literature. Among them all, the imbalance classification is the most critical and well-known problem. Imbalance classification consists of having a small number of observations of the minority class compared with the majority in the data set. In this problem, the ratio fraud: legitimate is very small, which makes it extremely difficult for the classification algorithm to detect fraud cases. In this paper, we will conduct a rigorous experimental study with the solutions that tackle the imbalance classification problem. We explored these solutions along with the machine learning algorithms used for fraud detection. We identified their weaknesses and summarized the results that we obtained using a credit card fraud labeled dataset. According to this paper, imbalanced classification approaches are ineffective, especially when the data are highly imbalanced. This paper reveals that the existing approaches result in a large number of false alarms, which are costly to financial institutions.

Data mining is a powerful technology to help organization to concentrate on most important data by extracting useful information from large database. With the improvement in technology day by day large amount of data are collected in raw form and as a result necessity of using data mining techniques in various domains are increasing. Class imbalance is an open challenge problem in data mining and machine learning. It occurs due to imbalanced data set. A data set is considered as imbalanced when a data set contains number of instance in one class vastly outnumber the number of instances in other class. When traditional data mining algorithms trained with imbalanced data sets, it gives suboptimal classification model. Recently class imbalance problem have gain significance attention from data mining and machine learning researcher community due to its presence in many real world problem such as remote-sensing, pollution detection, risk management, fraud detection and medical diagnosis.

However, most existing FER methods recognize facial expression images by training the CNN models with cross-entropy (CE) loss in a single stage, which have limited capability to deal with these problems because each expression example is assigned equal weight of loss. Inspired by the recently proposed focal loss which reduces the relative loss for those well-classified expression examples and pay more attention to those misclassified ones, we can mitigate these problems by introducing the focal loss into the existing FER system when facing imbalanced data or hard expression examples. Considering that the focal loss allows the network to further extract discriminative features based on the learned feature-separating capability, we present a two-stage training strategy utilizing CE loss in the first stage and focal loss in the second stage to boost the FER performance. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two well-known FER datasets called CK+ and Oulu-CASIA.

However, the performance of DNN-SER models is limited due to the following reasons: insufficient training data, emotion ambiguity and class imbalance. Studies show that, without large-scale training data, it is hard for DNN-SER model with cross-entropy loss to learn discriminative features by mapping the speech segments to their category labels. In this study, we propose a deep metric learning based DNN-SER model to facilitate the discriminative feature learning by constraining the feature embeddings in the feature space. For the proof of the concept, we take a four-hidden layer DNN as our backbone for implementation simplicity. Specifically, an emotion identity matrix is formed using one-hot label vectors as supervision information while the emotion embedding matrix is formed using the embedding vectors generated by DNN. An affinity loss is designed based on the above two matrices to simultaneously maximize the inter-class separability and intra-class compactness of the embeddings. Moreover, to restrain the class imbalance problem, the focal loss is introduced to reduce the adverse effect of the majority well-classified samples and gain more focus on the minority misclassified ones. Our proposed DNN-SER model is jointly trained using affinity loss and focal loss. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two well-known emotional speech datasets, EMO-DB and IEMOCAP. Compared to DNN-SER baseline, the unweighted accuracy (UA) on EMO-DB and IEMOCAP increased relatively by 10.19% and 10% respectively. Besides, from the confusion matrix of the test results on Emo-DB, it is noted that the accuracy of the most confusing emotion category, ‘Happiness’, increased relatively by 33.17% and the accuracy of the emotion category with the fewest samples, ‘Disgust’, increased relatively by 13.62%. These results validate the effectiveness of our proposed DNN-SER model and give the evidence that affinity loss and focal loss help to learn better discriminative features. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Affinity loss; Deep metric learning; Deep neural network; Focal loss; Speech emotion recognition","Springer Verlag"

Meanwhile, class imbalance learning often occurs simultaneously in class incremental learning when the new class emerges. Previous studies mainly proposed different methods to handle this problem. But these methods focus on classification tasks with a fixed class set and cannot adjust the peripheral contour features of the original instance distribution. As a result, the classification performance degrades seriously in an open dynamic environment, and the synthetic instances are always clustered within the original distribution. In order to solve class imbalance learning effectively in class incremental learning, we propose a Central-diffused Instance Generation Method to generate the instances of minority class as the new class emerging, called CdIGM. The key is to randomly shoot direction vectors of fixed length from the center of new class instances to expand the instance distribution space. The vectors diffuse to form a distribution which is optimized to satisfy properties that produce a multi-classification discriminative classifier with good performance. We conduct the experiments on both artificial data streams with different imbalance rates and real-world ones to compare CdIGM with some other proposed methods, e.g. SMOTE, OPCIL, OB and SDCIL. The experiment results show that CdIGM averagely achieves more than 4.01%, 4.49%, 8.81% and 9.76% performance improvement over SMOTE, OPCIL, OB and SDCIL, respectively, and outperforms in terms of overall and real-time accuracy.

Software defect data sets usually suffer from imbalance, where the number of defective modules is fewer than the number of defect-free modules.

Clustering-based under-sampling shows its ability to find good representatives of the majority data in different applications. This paper presents an approach for software defect prediction based on clustering-based under-sampling and Artificial Neural Network (ANN). Firstly, clustering-based under-sampling is used for selecting a subset of the majority samples, which is then combined with the minority samples to produce a balanced data set. Secondly, an ANN model is built and trained using the resulted balanced data set. The used ANN is trained to classify the software modules into defective or defect-free. In addition, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to choose the number of majority samples that yields the best performance measures. Results show the high prediction capability for the detection of defective modules while maintaining the ability of detecting defect-free modules.

This is because of not having efficient algorithms to put this data (i.e., generated data by billion of internetconnected devices (IoTs)) in respective format. Imbalanced data poses a great challenge to (both) data mining and machine learning algorithms. The imbalanced dataset consists of a majority class and a minority class, where the majority class takes the lead over the minority class. Generally, several standard learning algorithms assume the balanced class distribution or equal misclassification costs. If prediction is performed by these learning algorithms on imbalanced data, the accuracy will be high for majority classes, i.e., resulting in poor performance. To overcome this problem (or improving accuracy of deision/prediction-making process), data mining and machine learning researchers have addressed the problem of imbalanced data using datalevel, algorithmic level and ensemble or hybrid methods.

Many studies have been developed for bankruptcy prediction utilizing different machine learning approaches on various datasets around the world. Due to the class imbalance problem occurring in the bankruptcy datasets, several special techniques would be used to improve the prediction performance. Oversampling technique and cost-sensitive learning framework are two common methods for dealing with class imbalance problem. Using oversampling techniques and cost-sensitive learning framework independently also improves predictability. However, for datasets with very small balancing ratios, combining two above techniques will produce the better results.

In previous studies, it has been observed that many researchers have intension on the selection of appropriate algorithm for just classification and ignores the solutions of the problems which comes during data mining phases such as data high dimensionality, class imbalance and classification error etc. Such types of problems reduced the accuracy of the model. Several well-known classification algorithms are applied in this domain but this paper proposed a student performance prediction model based on supervised learning decision tree classifier. In addition, an ensemble method is applied to improve the performance of the classifier. Ensemble methods approach is designed to solve classification, prediction problems. This study proves the importance of data preprocessing and algorithms finetuning tasks to resolve the data quality issues. The experimental dataset used in this work belongs to Alentejo region of Portugal which is obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository. Three supervised learning algorithms (J48, NNge and MLP) are employed in this study for experimental purposes. The results showed that J48 achieved highest accuracy 95.78% among others. © 2019, Kassel University Press GmbH.","Decision tree; Educational data mining; Educational data mining; Ensemble; Predicting student performance","Kassel University Press GmbH"

A number of studies have been developing strategies to extract knowledge from the clinical data, aiming to identify important risk factors that can be used to prevent the recurrence of diseases. However, these studies do not focus on secondary cancer. Secondary cancer is lack of the strategies for clinical treatment as well as risk factor identification to prevent the occurrence. Methods: We propose an effective ensemble feature learning method to identify the risk factors for predicting secondary cancer by considering class imbalance and patient heterogeneity. We first divide the patients into some heterogeneous groups based on spectral clustering. In each group, we apply the oversampling method to balance the number of samples in each class and use them as training data for ensemble feature learning. The purpose of ensemble feature learning is to identify the risk factors and construct a diagnosis model for each group. The importance of risk factors is measured based on the properties of patients in each group separately. We predict secondary cancer by assigning the patient to a corresponding group and based on the diagnosis model in this corresponding group. Results: Analysis of the results shows that the decision tree obtains the best results for predicting secondary cancer in the three classifiers. The best results of the decision tree are 0.72 in terms of AUC when dividing the patients into 15 groups, 0.38 in terms of F1 score when dividing the patients into 20 groups. In terms of AUC, decision tree achieves 67.4% improvement compared to using all 20 predictor variables and 28.6% improvement compared to no group division. In terms of F1 score, decision tree achieves 216.7% improvement compared to using all 20 predictor variables and 80.9% improvement compared to no group division. Different groups provide different ranking results for the predictor variables. Conclusion: The accuracies of predicting secondary cancer using k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, support vector machine indeed increased after using the selected important risk factors as predictors. Group division on patients to predict secondary cancer on the separated models can further improve the prediction accuracies. The information discovered in the experiments can provide important references to the personality and clinical symptom representations on all phases of guide interventions, with the complexities of multiple symptoms associated with secondary cancer in all phases of the recurrent trajectory. © 2019 Ivyspring International Publisher.

Although it is a slow growing benign tumour, symptoms in the advanced phase can be serious. Hence, controlling tumour growth is essential and stereotactic radiosurgery, which can be performed with the CyberKnife robotic device, has proven effective for managing this disease. However, this approach may have side effects and a follow-up is necessary to assess its efficacy. To optimise the administration of this treatment, in this work we present a machine learning-based radiomics approach that first computes quantitative biomarkers from MR images routinely collected before the CyberKnife treatment and then predicts the treatment response. To tackle the challenge of class imbalance observed in the available dataset we present a cascade of cost-sensitive decision trees. We also experimentally compare the proposed approach with several approaches suited for learning under class skew. The results achieved demonstrate that radiomics has a great potential in predicting patients response to radiosurgery prior to the treatment that, in turns, can reflect into great advantages in therapy planning, sparing radiation toxicity and surgery when unnecessary.

Automated UAVs are now acquiring high quality images of the aircraft in order to perform offline analysis. At first, some acquisitions are annotated by human operators in order to provide a large dataset required to train machine learning methods, especially for critical defects detection. An intrinsic problem of this dataset is its extreme imbalance (i.e there is an unequal distribution between classes): The rarest and most valuable samples represent few elements among thousands of annotated objects. Deep Learning-only based approaches have proven to be very effective when a sufficient amount of data is available for each desired class, whereas less complex systems such as Support Vector Machine theoretically need less data, and few-shot learning dedicated methods (Matching Network, Prototypical Network, etc.) can learn from only few examples. Those approaches are compared on our applicative case. Preliminary results show the existence of empirical frontiers in term of training dataset volume that indicate which approach might be favored.

Hence in this paper, we developed an alternative hybrid fault prediction system based on Symbiotic Particle Swarm Optimization (SPSO) based subspace clustering and Ensemble Extreme Learning Machine (EELM) classifier. The SPSO based subspace clustering reduced the unnecessary learning of the entire system and provided efficient clustering. Then the EELM classifier evaluated the system to provide zero or minimum misclassification results.

However, the need for decision support systems cannot be denied because of most activities in the field of health care within the decision-making process. Decision support systems used for diagnosis are designed based on disease due to the complexity of diseases, symptoms, and disease-symptoms relationships. In the design and implementation of clinical decision support systems, mathematical modeling, pattern recognition and statistical analysis techniques of large databases and data mining techniques such as classification are also widely used. Classification of data is difficult in case of the small and/or imbalanced data set and this problem directly affects the classification performance. Small and/or imbalance dataset has become a major problem in data mining because classification algorithms are developed based on the assumption that the data sets are balanced and large enough. Most of the algorithms ignore or misclassify examples of the minority class, focus on the majority class. Most health data are small and imbalanced by nature. Learning from imbalanced and small data sets is an important and unsettled problem. Within the scope of the study, the publicly accessible data set, hepatitis was oversampled by distance-based data generation methods. The oversampled data sets were classified by using four different machine learning algorithms. Considering the classification scores of four different machine learning algorithms (Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree), optimal synthetic data generation rate is recommended. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

In particular, we focus on the imbalance problem of the training datasets for facial emotion classification. Since training a CNN with an imbalanced dataset tends to yield a learning bias toward the major classes and eventually leads to deterioration in the classification accuracy, it is required to increase the number of training images for the minority classes to have evenly distributed training images over all classes. However, it is difficult to find the images with a similar facial emotion for the oversampling. In this paper, we propose to use the AU features to retrieve an image with a similar emotion. The query selection from the minority class and the AU-based retrieval processes repeat until the numbers of training data over all classes are balanced. Also, to improve the classification accuracy, the AU features are fused with the CNN features to train a support vector machine (SVM) for final classification. The experiments have been conducted on three imbalanced facial image datasets, RAF-DB, FER2013, and ExpW. The results demonstrate that the CNNs trained with the AU features improve the classification accuracy by 3%-4%. © 2013 IEEE.","Convolutional neural network; data imbalance; data oversampling; facial action units; facial emotion recognition","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

In many bug trackers, e.g.Â Bugzilla, this is a time consuming process, because bug reporters must manually assign one of seven severity levels to each bug. In addition, some bug types may be reported more often than others, leading to a disproportionate distribution of severity labels. Machine learning techniques can be used to predict the label of a newly reported bug automatically. However, learning from imbalanced data in a multi-class task remains one of the major difficulties for machine learning classifiers. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical classification approach that exploits class imbalance in the training data, to reduce classification bias. Specifically, we designed a classification tree that consists of multiple binary classifiers organised hierarchically, such that instances from the most dominant class are trained against the remaining classes but are not used for training the next level of the classification tree. We used FastText classifier to test and compare between the hierarchical and standard classification approaches.

Previous studies conducted regarding prostate cancer diagnosis have been limited to microarray data, with limited successes. We utilized The Cancer Genome Atlas’ (TCGA) prostate cancer sequencing data to test the viability of fitting machine learning models to RNA sequencing data. A major challenge associated with the sequencing data is its high dimensionality. In this research, we addressed two complementary tasks. The first was to identify genes most associated with potential cancer. We started by using the mutual information metric to identify the most significant genes. Furthermore, we applied the Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm to reduce the number of genes needed to identify cancer. The second task was to create a classification model to separate potential high-risk patients from the healthy ones. For the second task, we combated the high dimensionality challenge with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). In addition to high dimensionality, another challenge is the imbalanced data set that has a 10:1 class imbalance of cancerous and healthy tissue respectively. To combat this problem, we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) to create synthetic observations and equalize the class distribution. We trained and tested a logistic regression model using 5-fold cross-validation. The results were promising, significantly reducing the false negative rate as compared to current diagnostic techniques while still keeping the false positive rate low. The model showed great improvements over previous machine learning attempts to diagnose prostate cancer. Our model could be applied as part of the patient diagnosis pipeline, helping to improve accuracy. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Auto-encoding; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Multi-layer perceptron; Mutual information; Prostate cancer diagnosis; Recursive feature elimination; RNA sequencing; The Cancer Genome Atlas; Upsampling","Springer Verlag"

In this paper, ensemble learning methods (specifically bagging and boosting) are used to balance the performance measures (sensitivity and specificity) on a diabetes dataset to predict if a patient will be readmitted to the hospital based on various feature vectors.

The particular state of an imbalanced dataset, where each class associated with a given dataset is distributed unevenly. This happens when the positive class is much smaller than the negative class. In this case, most standard classification algorithms do not identify examples related to the positive class. A positive class usually refers to the key interest of the classification task. In order to solve this problem, several solutions were proposed such as sampling-based over-sampling and under-sampling, changes at the classifier level or the combination of two or more classifiers. However the main problem is that most solutions are biased towards negative class, computationally expensive, have storage issues or taking long training time. An alternative approach to this problem is the genetic algorithm (GA), which has shown the promising results. The GA is an evolutionary learning algorithm that uses the principles of Darwinian evolution, it is a powerful global search algorithm. Moreover, the fitness function is a key parameter in GA. It determines how well a solution can solve the given problem.

Then, the system employs a variety of condition-based maintenance (CBM) methods to predict the time point when machines start to be operated abnormally and to maintain them or replace their components in advance so as to avoid manufacturing enormous detective products. CBM suffers from problems of concept drifts (i.e., the distribution of fault patterns may change over time) and imbalance data (i.e., the data with faults accounts for a minority of all data). Ensemble learning that integrates the diversity of multiple classifiers provides a high-performance solution to address these problems. In practice, most companies may not have a sufficient budget to establish a sound infrastructure to support real-time online classifiers, but may have off-the-shelf offline classifiers in their existing systems. However, most previous works on ensemble learning only focused on supporting online classifiers. Consequently, this work proposes an ensemble learning algorithm that supports offline classifiers to cope with three-stage CBM with concept drifts and imbalance data, in which Stages 1 (training an ensemble classifier) and 3 (creating a new ensemble) employ an improved Dynamic AdaBoost.NC classifier and the SMOTE method to address imbalance data; and Stage 2 (detecting concept drifts in imbalance data) employs an improved LFR (Linear Four Rates) method. The experimental results on datasets with different degrees of imbalance show that the proposed method can successfully detect all concept drifts, and has a high accuracy rate in detecting minority-class data, which is over 94%. © 2013 IEEE.","concept drift; data adaption; Ensemble learning; imbalance data; Industry 4.0; smart manufacturing","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

This paper proposes a Resample-based Ensemble Framework for Drifting Imbalanced Stream (RE-DI). The ensemble framework consists of a long-term static classifier to handle gradual and multiple dynamic classifiers to handle sudden concept drift. The weights of the ensemble classifier are adjusted from two aspects. First, a time-decayed strategy decreases the weights of the dynamic classifiers to make the ensemble classifier focus more on the new concept of the data stream. Second, a novel reinforcement mechanism is proposed to increase the weights of the base classifiers that perform better on the minority class and decrease the weights of the classifiers that perform worse. A resampling buffer is used for storing the instances of the minority class to balance the imbalanced distribution over time. In our experiment, we compare the proposed method with other state-of-the-art algorithms on both real-world and synthetic data streams.

For two-class data, imbalanced data are characterized by the size of one class (majority class) being much larger than that of the other class (minority class), which makes the constructed models focus more on the majority class and ignore or even misclassify the examples of the minority class. The undersampling-based ensemble, which learns individual classifiers from undersampled balanced data, is an effective method to cope with the class-imbalance data. The problem in this method is that the size of the dataset to train each classifier is notably small; thus, how to generate individual classifiers with high performance from the limited data is a key to the success of the method. In this paper, rotation forest (an ensemble method) is used to improve the performance of the undersampling-based ensemble on the imbalanced problem because rotation forest has higher performance than other ensemble methods such as bagging, boosting, and random forest, particularly for small-sized data. In addition, rotation forest is more sensitive to the sampling technique than some robust methods including SVM and neural networks; thus, it is easier to create individual classifiers with diversity using rotation forest. Two versions of the improved undersampling-based ensemble methods are implemented: 1) undersampling subsets from the majority class and learning each classifier using the rotation forest on the data obtained by combing each subset with the minority class and 2) similarly to the first method, with the exception of removing the majority class examples that are correctly classified with high confidence after learning each classifier for further consideration. The experimental results show that the proposed methods show significantly better performance on measures of recall, g-mean, f-measure, and AUC than other state-of-the-art methods on 30 datasets with various data distributions and different imbalance ratios. © TÜBİTAK","Ensemble; Imbalanced problem; Rotation forest; Undersampling","Turkiye Klinikleri"

However, like most representative supervised learning algorithms, ELM tends to produce biased decision models when datasets are imbalanced. In this paper, two-stage weighted regularized ELM is proposed to address the aforementioned issue. The original regularized ELM (RELM) was proposed to handle adverse effects of outliers but not target the imbalanced learning problem. So we proposed a new weighted regularized ELM (WRELM) for class imbalance learning (CIL) in the first stage. Different from the existing weighted ELM which only considers the class distribution of datasets, the proposed algorithm also puts more focus on hard, misclassified samples in the second stage. The focal loss function is adopted to update weight by decreasing the weight of well-classified samples to focus more attention on the error of difficult samples. The final decision target is determined by the winner-take-all method. We assess the proposed method on 25 binary datasets and 10 multiclass datasets by 5-folder cross validations. The results indicate the proposed algorithm is an efficient method for CIL and exceed other CIL algorithms based on ELM. &#x00A9; 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Class imbalance learning (CIL); Cost-sensitive learning; Extreme learning machine","Springer Verlag"

Studies have focused on the readmission frequency analysis stratified by disease and demographic/geographic characteristics but there are no predictive modeling approaches, which may be useful to identify preventable readmissions that constitute a major portion of the cost attributed to readmissions. Objective. To assess the all-cause readmission predictive performance achieved by machine learning techniques in the emergency department of a pediatric hospital in Santiago, Chile. Materials. An all-cause admissions dataset has been collected along six consecutive years in a pediatric hospital in Santiago, Chile. The variables collected are the same used for the determination of the child's treatment administrative cost. Methods. Retrospective predictive analysis of 30-day readmission was formulated as a binary classification problem. We report classification results achieved with various model building approaches after data curation and preprocessing for correction of class imbalance. We compute repeated cross-validation (RCV) with decreasing number of folders to assess performance and sensitivity to effect of imbalance in the test set and training set size. Results. Increase in recall due to SMOTE class imbalance correction is large and statistically significant. The Naive Bayes (NB) approach achieves the best AUC (0.65); however the shallow multilayer perceptron has the best PPV and f-score (5.6 and 10.2, resp.). The NB and support vector machines (SVM) give comparable results if we consider AUC, PPV, and f-score ranking for all RCV experiments. High recall of deep multilayer perceptron is due to high false positive ratio. There is no detectable effect of the number of folds in the RCV on the predictive performance of the algorithms. Conclusions. We recommend the use of Naive Bayes (NB) with Gaussian distribution model as the most robust modeling approach for pediatric readmission prediction, achieving the best results across all training dataset sizes.

A dataset is said to be unstructured when the majority of the class has more samples insignificantly than the minor class. Such drawbacks result in an ineffective performance of data classification techniques. Classification is a supervised learning method which acquires a training dataset to form its model for classifying unseen examples. However, in unstructured data classification, the class boundary learned by standard machine learning algorithms can be severely skewed toward the target class. As a result, the false-negative rate can be excessively high. The researches focus on the unstructured data classification using uncertain Nearest Neighbor (NN) decision rule and also found the major issues face by k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). In any case, given a dataset, prediction of accuracy is a monotonous task to improve the execution of kNN by tuning &#x01d458;. Because of class imbalance, the performance of kNN decreases and this situation is represented by dissimilar characteristic from various classes. This paper addresses the issues faced by kNN by developing Adaptive-Condensed NN (Ada-CNN). The Ada-CNN classifier utilizes the distribution and density of test point's neighborhood and learn an appropriate point-explicit &#x01d458; by using artificial neural systems.

In the field of gastroenterology, physicians handle large amounts of clinical data and various kinds of image devices such as endoscopy and ultrasound. AI has been applied in gastroenterology in terms of diagnosis, prognosis, and image analysis. However, potential inherent selection bias cannot be excluded in the form of retrospective study. Because overfitting and spectrum bias (class imbalance) have the possibility of overestimating the accuracy, external validation using unused datasets for model development, collected in a way that minimizes the spectrum bias, is mandatory. For robust verification, prospective studies with adequate inclusion/exclusion criteria, which represent the target populations, are needed. DL has its own lack of interpretability.

In this paper, we present a consensus clustering based-undersampling approach to imbalanced learning. In this scheme, the number of instances in the majority class was undersampled by utilizing a consensus clustering-based scheme. In the empirical analysis, 44 small-scale and 2 large-scale imbalanced classification benchmarks have been utilized. In the consensus clustering schemes, five clustering algorithms (namely, k-means, k-modes, k-means++, self-organizing maps, and DIANA algorithm) and their combinations were taken into consideration. In the classification phase, five supervised learning methods (namely, naïve Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, random forests, and k-nearest neighbor algorithm) and three ensemble learner methods (namely, AdaBoost, bagging, and random subspace algorithm) were utilized. The empirical results indicate that the proposed heterogeneous consensus clustering-based undersampling scheme yields better predictive performance. © 2019 Aytuǧ Onan.",,"Hindawi Limited"

Imbalance class learning is one of the most challenging issues for classification. In recent years, the core focal point of numerous researchers has been on data classification of multi-class imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we proposed semi-supervised deep Fuzzy C-mean clustering for imbalanced multi-class classification (DFCM-MC). In our paper, the word 'Deep' is used to show how decomposition strategy is applied deeply, first, decomposes the original semi-supervised data into supervised (labeled) and unsupervised (unlabeled) data. For training the model, we used unlabeled data along with labeled data to extract discriminative information, which is useful for classification. Second, it further decomposes the supervised and unsupervised data into multi intra-cluster that to address the problem of multi-class imbalance data, which tends to maximize intra-cluster classes and intra-cluster features. We propose a novel approach DFCM-MC by utilizing multi-intra clusters to extract new features to control redundancy for multi-class imbalance classification, which associates the maximum similarity of features between multi-intra clusters. Furthermore, we improve the classification performance of the DFCM-MC, apply the re-sampling technique to handle the imbalance data for classification. We conduct our experiments on 18 benchmark multi-class imbalanced datasets to demonstrate the performance of our proposed approach with the four state-of-the-art learning algorithms for multi-class imbalance data with three performance measures (mean of accuracy, mean of f-measure, and mean of area under the curve). The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed approach performs better due to their capacity to recognize and consolidate fundamental information from unsupervised data. © 2019 IEEE.","feature learning; Fuzzy C-mean clustering; imbalanced data; multi-class classification; Semi-supervised learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Particularly, with the change of emphasis from curative to preventive medicine, the importance of data-based research such as data mining and machine learning has emphasized the issues of class distributions in datasets. In typical predictive modeling, the inability to effectively address a class imbalance in a real-life dataset is an important shortcoming of the existing machine learning algorithms. Most algorithms assume a balanced class in their design, resulting in poor performance in predicting the minority target class. Ironically, the minority target class is usually the focus in predicting processes. The misclassification of the minority target class has resulted in serious consequences in detecting chronic diseases and detecting fraud and intrusion where positive cases are erroneously predicted as not positive. This paper presents a new attribute selection technique called variance ranking for handling imbalance class problems in a dataset. The results obtained were compared to two well-known attribute selection techniques: the Pearson correlation and information gain technique. This paper uses a novel similarity measurement technique ranked order similarity-ROS to evaluate the variance ranking attribute selection compared to the Pearson correlations and information gain. Further validation was carried out using three binary classifications: logistic regression, support vector machine, and decision tree. The proposed variance ranking and ranked order similarity techniques showed better results than the benchmarks. The ROS technique provided an excellent means of grading and measuring the similarities where other similarity measurement techniques were inadequate or not applicable. © 2013 IEEE.","binary class; class distribution; decision tree; imbalance ratio; Imbalanced dataset; logistic regression; majority class; minority class; oversampling; peak threshold accuracy; ranked order similarity; support vector machine; under sampling","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

This research focuses on ten metrics based on a binary confusion matrix and their symmetric behaviour is formally defined under all types of transformations. Through simulated experiments, which cover the full range of datasets and classification results, the symmetric behaviour of these metrics is explored by exposing them to hundreds of simple or combined symmetric transformations. Cross-symmetries among the metrics and statistical symmetries are also explored. The results obtained show that, in all cases, three and only three types of symmetries arise: labelling inversion (between positive and negative classes); scoring inversion (concerning good and bad classifiers); and the combination of these two inversions. Additionally, certain metrics have been shown to be independent of the imbalance in the dataset and two cross-symmetries have been identified. The results regarding their symmetries reveal a deeper insight into the behaviour of various performance metrics and offer an indicator to properly interpret their values and a guide for their selection for certain specific applications. © 2019 by the authors.","Classification; Computational symmetry; Machine learning; Performance metrics","MDPI AG"

Detecting HWDs is the first crucial step toward clinical or teaching intervention for children with HWDs. To date, how to automatically detect HWDs is still a challenge, although digitizing tablets have provided an opportunity to automatically collect handwriting process information. Especially, to our best knowledge, there is no exploration into the potential of combining machine learning algorithms and the handwriting process information to automatically detect Chinese HWDs in children. To bridge the gap, we first conducted an experiment to collect sample data and then compared the performance of five commonly used classification algorithms (Decision tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network, Naïve Bayesian and k-Nearest Neighbor) in detecting HWDs. The results showed that: (1) only a small proportion (13%) of children had Chinese HWDs and each classification model on the imbalanced dataset (39 children at risk of HWDs versus 261 typical children) produced the results that were better than random guesses, indicating the possibility of using classification algorithms to detect Chinese HWDs; (2) the SVM model had the best performance in detecting Chinese HWDs among the five classification models; and (3) the performance of the SVM model, especially its sensitivity, could be significantly improved by employing the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique to handle the class-imbalanced data. This study gains new insights into which handwriting features are predictive of Chinese HWDs in children and proposes a method that can help the clinical and educational professionals to automatically detect children at risk of Chinese HWDs.

The application of CNNs in image analysis and pattern recognition has earned a lot of attention in this regard and few applications to classify a small number of common taxa in marine image collections have been reported yet. In this paper, we address the problem of class imbalance in marine image data, i.e. the common observation that 80%–90% of the data belong to a small subset of $$L^\prime $$ classes among the total number of L observed classes, with $$L^\prime \ll L$$. A small number of methods to compensate for the class imbalance problem in the training step have been proposed for the common computer vision benchmark datasets. But marine image collections (showing for instance megafauna as considered in this study) pose a greater challenge as the observed imbalance is more extreme as habitats can feature a high biodiversity but a low species density. In this paper, we investigate the potential of various over-/undersampling methods to compensate for the class imbalance problem in marine imaging. In addition, five different balancing rules are proposed and analyzed to examine the extent to which sampling should be used, i.e. how many samples should be created or removed to gain the most out of the sampling algorithms. We evaluate these methods with AlexNet trained for classifying benthic image data recorded at the Porcupine Abyssal Plain (PAP) and use a Support Vector Machine as baseline classifier. We can report that the best of our proposed strategies in combination with data augmentation applied to AlexNet results in an increase of thirteen basis points compared to AlexNet without sampling. Furthermore, examples are presented, which show that the combination of oversampling and augmentation leads to a better generalization than pure augmentation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Class imbalance; CNN; Deep learning; Marine imaging; Taxonomic classification","Springer Verlag"

The recent popularity of cloud-based computing and the realization of the associated risks are the main reasons for this research thrust. The proposed research demonstrates that machine learning algorithms can be effectively used to enhance the performance of existing intrusion detection systems despite the high misclassification rates reported in the literature. This paper reports on an empirical investigation to determine the underlying causes of the poor performance of some of the well-known machine learning classifiers. Especially when learning from minor classes/attacks. The main factor is that the KDD cup 99 dataset, which is popularly used in most of the existing research, is an imbalanced dataset due to the nature of the specific intrusion detection domain, i.e. some attacks being rare and some being very frequent. Therefore, there is a significant imbalance amongst the classes in the dataset. Based on the number of the classes in the dataset, the imbalance dataset issue can be considered a binary problem or a multi-class problem. Most of the researchers focus on conducting a binary class classification as conducting a multi-class classification is complex. In the research proposed in this paper, we consider the problem as a multi-class classification task. The paper investigates the use of different machine learning algorithms in order to overcome the common misclassification problems that have been faced by researchers who used the imbalance KDD cup 99 dataset for their investigations.

Such instability can cause sudden large-scale changes in output, called ramp events; the frequency of such events is relatively low throughout the year but they could negatively affect the supply-demand balance in a power system. This study focuses on an alerting scheme of wind power ramp events for a transmission system operator to support operational decisions on cold reserve power plants. The ramp alerting scheme is implemented from the viewpoint of supervised learning by using the prediction results of wind power output. In particular, the authors address the class imbalance problem, as the accuracy of ramp event prediction tends to be low because of the infrequency of such ramp events in the database used for learning. In this study, several data sampling strategies are proposed and implemented to overcome the problem in the ramp alert task. The effectiveness of the proposed data sampling framework is evaluated experimentally by predicting real-world wind power ramps, based on a dataset collected in Japan.

Previous research focuses on one or another of these aspects or addresses them disjointly. We propose a hybrid network architecture that jointly models spatial and temporal representations and their correlation. In particular, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn spatial representations, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to model temporal dependencies among them. The outputs of CNNs and LSTMs are aggregated into a fusion network to produce per-frame prediction of multiple AUs. The hybrid network was compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches in two large FACS-coded video databases, GFT and BP4D, with over 400,000 AU-coded frames of spontaneous facial behavior in varied social contexts. Relative to standard multi-label CNN and feature-based state-of-the-art approaches, the hybrid system reduced person-specific biases and obtained increased accuracy for AU detection. To address class imbalance within and between batches during network training, we introduce multi-labeling sampling strategies that further increase accuracy when AUs are relatively sparse. Finally, we provide visualization of the learned AU models, which, to the best of our best knowledge, reveal for the first time how machines see AUs. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Deep learning; Facial action unit detection; Multi-label learning; Multi-label sampling; Spatio-temporal learning; Video analysis","Elsevier Ltd"

Methods: 1597 patients from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging (MCSA) were reviewed for imaging characteristics of DESH. One core feature of DESH, the presence of tightened sulci in the high-convexities (THC), was used as a surrogate for the presence of DESH as the expert clinician-defined criterion on which the classifier was trained. Anatomical MRI scans were automatically segmented for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and overlaid with an atlas of 123 named sulcal regions. The volume of CSF in each sulcal region was summed and normalized to total intracranial volume. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values were computed for each region individually, and these values determined feature selection for the machine learning model. Due to class imbalance in the data (72 selected scans out of 1597 total scans) adaptive synthetic sampling (a technique which generates synthetic examples based on the original data points) was used to balance the data. A support vector machine model was then trained on the regions selected. Results: Using the automated classification model, we were able to classify scans for tightened sulci in the high convexities, as defined by the expert clinician, with an AUROC of about 0.99 (false negative ≈ 2%, false positive ≈ 5%). Ventricular volumes were among the classifier's most discriminative features but are not specific for DESH. The inclusion of regions outside the ventricles allowed specificity from atrophic neurodegenerative diseases that are also accompanied by ventricular enlargement. Conclusion: Automated detection of tight high convexity, a key imaging feature of DESH, is possible by using support vector machine models with selected sulcal CSF volumes as features. © 2018 The Authors","Computer-aided diagnosis; Disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid hydrocephalus; Normal pressure ydrocephalus; Support vector machines; Tight high-convexity","Elsevier Inc."

However, LSSVM has bad performance on minority class facing with class imbalance learning for the classification boundary skewing toward the majority class. In order to overcome the drawback, LSSVM for class imbalance learning (LSSVM-CIL) is proposed. LSSVM-CIL utilizes two different regularization parameters C+ and C− that evaluate different misclassification costs. Furthermore, a method of combining reduced technique and recursive strategy is proposed to reduce the size of support vectors and retain representative samples. In addition, decomposition of the matrices via Cholesky factorization is employed as a solution to enhance the computational stability. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the two algorithms presented in this paper is confirmed with experimental results on various real-world imbalanced datasets. Fault detection of aircraft engine can be regarded as a CIL problem and has the demand for the real time. Finally, experiments on aircraft engine indicate that the two algorithms can be selected as candidate techniques for fault detection of aircraft engine. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS","Aircraft engine; Cholesky factorization; Class imbalance learning; Fault detection; Support vector machine","Elsevier Masson SAS"

A dataset is considered as imbalanced when number of examples in one class is more or less compared to another class. Data mining algorithms may generate suboptimal classification models when trained with imbalanced datasets. Several techniques have been proposed to solve the class imbalance problem. One of them includes boosting which is combined with resampling technique. It has gained popularity to solve class imbalance problem, for example, Random Undersampling Boosting (RUSBoost) and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Boosting Technique (SMOTEBoost). RUSBoost method uses random undersampling technique as resampling technique. One of the disadvantages of random undersampling may include loss of important data which is overcome by redundancy-driven modified Tomek-link based undersampling. A new hybrid undersampling algorithm is proposed in which we use redundancy-driven modified Tomek-link based undersampling as resampling technique along with boosting for learning from imbalanced training data.

When running on a continuous and steep descent, the air brake operation strategy has become the most important issue for the safety and efficiency of heavy haul train transportation. Due to the difficulty in modeling the train's dynamics and pneumatic brake system precisely, this paper addresses the intelligent driving problem for heavy haul train based on the fusion of expert knowledge and machine learning methodologies. By considering the characteristics of manual driving on steep descent, the pneumatic brake operation problem is formulated as a multi-class classification model. To overcome the negative influences of data imbalances, EasyEnsemble for the multi-class with a KNN based Denoising (EMKD) algorithm is introduced to determine the feasible Air Pressure Reduction (APR) and the exact time for exerting and releasing the air brake. This approach utilizes the EasyEnsemble.M algorithm to moderate the class imbalanced datasets and takes advantage of the AdaBoost.M1 algorithm to ensemble weak classifiers. Specifically, the K-nearest neighbor based Denoising (KD) algorithm is elaborated to remove the possible noise data from the minority dataset. Additionally, expert knowledge is obtained by abstracting the experience of sophisticated drivers and technical specifications, which are employed as operating constraints to regulate the output of the EMKD algorithm. The operational safety in terms of the in-train forces and punctuality of the proposed algorithm are validated by a number of experiments under the real running circumstances of Shuohuang heavy haul railway. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Air brake; Heavy haul train; Imbalanced data; Intelligent operation; Machine learning","Elsevier B.V."

Diagnosis of DR requires an experienced ophthalmologist and it is a tedious and time-consuming process. In this paper, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based automated diagnosis system that can classify various stages of DR accurately. A hierarchical approach is adopted for classification in which we break down our classification task into two stages. In the first stage we perform binary classification obtaining the true positive and negative samples and in the second stage, five class classification is performed on those images classified as true positive, false positive and false negative in the first stage of classification. Our approach of classifying hierarchically takes care of the class imbalance in the data by removing the most dominant class 0 (No-DR) from the dataset at the binary classification stage. The proposed method uses the Inception-v3 CNN for feature extraction in which we use the features from second last layer of both main and auxiliary classifiers. The extracted features are concatenated into a single feature vector to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM). We use SVM with Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel for both binary and multiclass classifications. Experiments are conducted on ""Kaggle""dataset and our approach attains an accuracy of 87.7% on validation data for binary classification and 81.8% for multiclass classification.

Effective noise detection has been achieved by adopting an ensemble of classifiers. In this approach, an instance is assigned as mislabeled if a high proportion of members in the pool misclassifies that instance. Previous authors have empirically evaluated this approach with interesting results, nevertheless, they mostly assumed that label noise is generated completely at random in a dataset. This is a gap in the literature since there are other types of label noise which are feasible in practice and can influence noise detection results. This paper investigates the performance of ensemble noise detection in a different noise model, the Noisy at Random (NAR) model, in which the probability of label noise depends on the instance class. In this setting, we also investigate the effect of class distribution on noise detection performance, since it changes the total noise level observed in a dataset under the NAR assumption. It is shown in a number of performed experiments that the choice for a noise generation model over another can lead to distinct results when taking in consideration aspects such as class imbalance and noise level ratio among different classes. © 2018 IEEE.","Class noise; Ensemble methods; Label noise; Noisy at Random","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

In its advanced forms it carries severe outcomes and can lead to death. It is thus important to detect the disease as early as possible, which can help devise effective intervention and treatment plan. Here we investigate ways to utilize information available in electronic health records (EHRs) from regular office visits of more than 13,000 patients, in order to distinguish among several stages of the disease. While clinical data stored in EHRs provide valuable information for risk-stratification, one of the major challenges in using them arises from data imbalance. That is, records associated with a more severe condition are typically under-represented compared to those associated with a milder manifestation of the disease. To address imbalance, we propose and develop a sampling-based ensemble approach, hierarchical meta-classification, aiming to stratify CKD patients into severity stages, using simple quantitative non-text features gathered from standard office visit records. Methods: The proposed hierarchical meta-classification method frames the multiclass classification task as a hierarchy of two subtasks. The first is binary classification, separating records associated with the majority class from those associated with all minority classes combined, using meta-classification. The second subtask separates the records assigned to the combined minority classes into the individual constituent classes. Results: The proposed method identifies a significant proportion of patients suffering from the more advanced stages of the condition, while also correctly identifying most of the less severe cases, maintaining high sensitivity, specificity and F-measure (≥ 93%). Our results show that the high level of performance attained by our method is preserved even when the size of the training set is significantly reduced, demonstrating the stability and generalizability of our approach. Conclusion: We present a new approach to perform classification while addressing data imbalance, which is inherent in the biomedical domain. Our model effectively identifies severity stages of CKD patients, using information readily available in office visit records within the realistic context of high data imbalance. © 2018 The Author(s).","Electronic health records; Hierarchical classification; Imbalanced data; Kidney disease; Meta-classification","BioMed Central Ltd"

Most of real-world biomedical datasets are usually along with limited samples and high-dimensional feature. This seriously affects the classification performance of the model and causes erroneous guidance for the diagnosis of diseases. Exploring an effective classification method for imbalanced and limited biomedical dataset is a challenging task. Methods: In this paper, we propose a novel multilayer extreme learning machine (ELM) classification model combined with dynamic generative adversarial net (GAN) to tackle limited and imbalanced biomedical data. Firstly, principal component analysis is utilized to remove irrelevant and redundant features. Meanwhile, more meaningful pathological features are extracted. After that, dynamic GAN is designed to generate the realistic-looking minority class samples, thereby balancing the class distribution and avoiding overfitting effectively. Finally, a self-adaptive multilayer ELM is proposed to classify the balanced dataset. The analytic expression for the numbers of hidden layer and node is determined by quantitatively establishing the relationship between the change of imbalance ratio and the hyper-parameters of the model. Reducing interactive parameters adjustment makes the classification model more robust. Results: To evaluate the classification performance of the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted on four real-world biomedical datasets. The proposed method can generate authentic minority class samples and self-adaptively select the optimal parameters of learning model. By comparing with W-ELM, SMOTE-ELM, and H-ELM methods, the quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve better classification performance and higher computational efficiency in terms of ROC, AUC, G-mean, and F-measure metrics. Conclusions: Our study provides an effective solution for imbalanced biomedical data classification under the condition of limited samples and high-dimensional feature. The proposed method could offer a theoretical basis for computer-aided diagnosis.

As a Cost-Free Learning (CFL) method, Mutual-Information Classification (MIC) can obtain the optimal classification results when the cost information is not given. But this method emphasizes the data of minority class too much and neglects the accuracy of the classification of majority class.

Change-proneness prediction on file level with binary classification methods makes such identification possible. As the fact that change-prone files frequently account for a small part of all the files, the prediction performance of standard classification methods is not satisfying. In this paper, we employ imbalanced learning methods, including bagging, resampling, and especially their combination to reduce the performance decrease of standard classifiers caused by the class imbalance problem in change-proneness prediction. Besides, we propose a boxplot-based partition method to provide more proper change-proneness label designation for the training data.

The SSC provides sleep stage information of a patient throughout an entire sleep test. A physician uses results from SSCs to diagnose sleep disorder symptoms. However, the SSC data processing is time-consuming and requires trained sleep technicians to complete the task. Over the years, researchers attempted to find alternative methods, which are known as Automatic Sleep Stage Classification (ASSC), to perform the task faster and more efficiently. Proposed ASSC techniques usually derived from existing statistical methods and machine learning (ML) techniques. The objective of this study is to develop a new hybrid ASSC technique, Multi-Layer Hybrid Machine Learning Model (MLHM), for classifying sleep stages. The MLHM blends two baseline ML techniques, Decision Tree (DT) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). It operates on a newly developed multi-layer architecture. The multi-layer architecture consists of three layers for classifying W, R and N1, N2, N3 in different epoch lengths. Our experiment design compares MLHM and baseline ML techniques and other research works. The dataset used in this study was derived from the ISRUC-Sleep database comprising of 100 subjects. The classification performances were thoroughly reviewed using the hold-out and the 10-fold cross-validation method in both subject-specific and subject-independent classifications. The MLHM achieved a certain satisfactory classification results. It gained 0.694±0.22 of accuracy (AUC=0.822±0.31) in subject-specific classification and 0.942±0.02 of accuracy (AUC=0.920±0.17) in subject-independent classification. The pros and cons of the MLHM with the multi-layer architecture were thoroughly discussed.

LiDAR data has been increasingly used, separately or in conjunction with other remote sensing data, for providing land cover classification due to its high geometric accuracy as well as its additional radiometric information. An important issue in the classification of remote sensing data is the inevitable imbalance of training samples, which usually results in poor classification performance in classes with few samples (minority classes). In this paper, a synergy of sampling techniques in data mining with ensemble classifiers is proposed to address the data imbalance problem in the training datasets. Several sampling strategies, including under-sampling the majority classes, synthetic over-sampling the minority classes, hybrid-sampling, and under-sampling aggregation are examined. The results from two different datasets show superior performance of ensemble classifiers when integrated with sampling techniques.

Incident delirium was defined as the first instance of a positive CAM occurring at least 48 h into a hospital stay.

This rising elderly population continues to demand more cost-effective healthcare programs. Medicare is a vital program serving the needs of the elderly in the United States. The growing number of Medicare beneficiaries, along with the enormous volume of money in the healthcare industry, increases the appeal for, and risk of, fraud. In this paper, we focus on the detection of Medicare Part B provider fraud which involves fraudulent activities, such as patient abuse or neglect and billing for services not rendered, perpetrated by providers and other entities who have been excluded from participating in Federal healthcare programs. We discuss Part B data processing and describe a unique process for mapping fraud labels with known fraudulent providers. The labeled big dataset is highly imbalanced with a very limited number of fraud instances. In order to combat this class imbalance, we generate seven class distributions and assess the behavior and fraud detection performance of six different machine learning methods. Our results show that RF100 using a 90:10 class distribution is the best learner with a 0.87302 AUC. Moreover, learner behavior with the 50:50 balanced class distribution is similar to more imbalanced distributions which keep more of the original data. Based on the performance and significance testing results, we posit that retaining more of the majority class information leads to better Medicare Part B fraud detection performance over the balanced datasets across the majority of learners. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Big data; Class imbalance; Medicare fraud; Random undersampling","Springer International Publishing"

Conventional extreme learning machine (ELM) gives equal importance to all the samples leading to the results which favor the majority-class. Numerous variants of ELM-like weighted ELM (WELM), class-specific cost regulation ELM (CCR-ELM), class-specific ELM (CS-ELM) etc. have been proposed in order to diminish the performance degradation which happens due to the class imbalance problem. ELM with Gaussian kernel outperforms the ELM with Sigmoid node. This work proposed a novel class-specific kernelized ELM (CSKELM) which is a variant of kernelized ELM to address the class imbalance problem more effectively. CSKELM with Gaussian kernel function avoids the non-optimal hidden node problem associated with CS-ELM and the other existing variants of ELM. This work is distinct from WELM because it does not require the assignment of weights to the training samples. In addition, the proposed work also has considerably lower computational cost in contrast with kernelized WELM. This work employs class-specific regularization in the same way as CS-ELM. This work differs from CS-ELM as the proposed CSKELM uses the Gaussian kernel function to map the input data to the feature space. The proposed work also has lower computational overhead in contrast with kernelized CCR-ELM. The proposed work is assessed by employing benchmark real-world imbalanced datasets downloaded from the KEEL dataset repository.

Identifying RBPs by computation and experiment are both essential. Recently, an RBP predictor, RBPPred, is proposed in our group to predict RBPs. However, RBPPred is too slow for that it needs to generate PSSM matrix as its feature. Herein, based on the protein feature of RBPPred and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), we develop a deep learning model called Deep-RBPPred. With the balance and imbalance training set, we obtain Deep-RBPPred-balance and Deep-RBPPred-imbalance models. Deep-RBPPred has three advantages comparing to previous methods. (1) Deep-RBPPred only needs few physicochemical properties based on protein sequences. (2) Deep-RBPPred runs much faster. (3) Deep-RBPPred has a good generalization ability. In the meantime, Deep-RBPPred is still as good as the state-of-the-art method. Testing in A. thaliana, S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens proteomes, MCC values are 0.82 (0.82), 0.65 (0.69) and 0.85 (0.80) for balance model (imbalance model) when the score cutoff is set to 0.5, respectively. In the same testing dataset, different machine learning algorithms (CNN and SVM) are also compared. The results show that CNN-based model can identify more RBPs than SVM-based. In comparing the balance and imbalance model, both CNN-base and SVM-based tend to favor the majority class in the imbalance set. Deep-RBPPred forecasts 280 (balance model) and 265 (imbalance model) of 299 new RBP. The sensitivity of balance model is about 7% higher than the state-of-the-art method. We also apply deep-RBPPred to 30 eukaryotes and 109 bacteria proteomes downloaded from Uniprot to estimate all possible RBPs. The estimating result shows that rates of RBPs in eukaryote proteomes are much higher than bacteria proteomes. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"Nature Publishing Group"

Learning from imbalanced data is challenging as most standard algorithms fail to properly represent the inherent complex characteristics of the data distribution. As an emerging technology, the extreme learning machine (ELM) and its variants, including the weighted ELM (WELM) and the boosting weighted ELM (BWELM), have been recently developed for the classification of imbalanced data. However, the WELM suffers the following deficiencies: (i) the sample weight matrix is manually chosen and fixed during the learning phase; (ii) the representation capability, namely the capability to extract features or useful information from the original data, is insufficiently explored due to its shallow structure. The BWELM employs the AdaBoost algorithm to optimize the sample weights. But the representation capability is still restricted by the shallow structure. To alleviate these deficiencies, we propose a novel deep weighted ELM (DWELM) algorithm for imbalanced data classification in this paper. An enhanced stacked multilayer deep representation network trained with the ELM (EH-DrELM) is first proposed to improve the representation capability, and a fast AdaBoost algorithm for imbalanced multiclass data (AdaBoost-ID) is developed to optimize the sample weights. Then, the novel DWELM for the imbalance learning is obtained by combining the above two algorithms. Experimental results on nine imbalanced binary-class datasets, nine imbalanced multiclass datasets, and five large benchmark datasets (three for multiclass and two for binary-class) show that the proposed DWELM achieves a better performance than the WELM and BWELM, as well as several state-of-the-art multilayer network-based learning algorithms. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","AdaBoost; Deep learning; Extreme learning machine; Imbalanced data; Weighted extreme learning machine","Springer New York LLC"

Specifically, the focus is to determine degree of infarction in regions of the left ventricle based on information extracted from cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Enhanced classification accuracy is achieved using three mechanisms: Firstly, a plurality of indices/features is used in the pattern classification process, rather than a single index/feature (hence the term “multi-dimensional). Secondly, the method incorporates not only the indices/features of the region in consideration, but also indices/features from the neighbouring regions (hence the term “proprio-proximus”). Thirdly, advanced machine learning techniques are used for both feature selection and pattern classification process to ameliorate the effect of class-imbalance existing in the data. Numerical results from multiple experiments on real data showed that using multiple features improved the ability to distinguish between infarcted and non-infarcted remote segments, and using neighbouring information improved classification performance.

The order by which the features are selected is also better, leading to a higher accuracy for fewer features. The experimental results indicate that our technique can be employed effectively in offline scenarios when one can dedicate more CPU time to achieve superior results and more robustness to noise and to class imbalance. © 2012 IEEE.","Feature evaluation and selection; indexing methods; information theory; machine learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

PBG is effective due to three reasons. 1) Through postadjusting a classification boundary under extended G-mean, the challenging issue of imbalanced class distribution for sequentially arriving multiclass data can be effectively resolved. 2) A newly derived update rule for online sequential learning is proposed, which produces a high G-mean for current model and simultaneously possesses almost the same information of its previous models. 3) A dynamic adjustment mechanism provided by extended G-mean is valid to deal with the unresolved challenging dense-majority problem and two dynamic changing issues, namely, dynamic changing data scarcity (DCDS) and dynamic changing data diversity (DCDD). Compared to other OS-MIL methods, PBG is highly effective on resolving DCDS, while PBG is the only method to resolve dense-majority and DCDD. Furthermore, PBG can directly and effectively handle unscaled data stream. Experiments have been conducted for PBG and two popular OS-MIL methods for neural networks under massive binary and multiclass data sets. Through the analyses of experimental results, PBG is shown to outperform the other compared methods on all data sets in various aspects including the issues of data scarcity, dense-majority, DCDS, DCDD, and unscaled data. © 2012 IEEE.","Dynamic changing distribution; extreme learning machine; imbalance class distribution; multiclass imbalance learning; online sequential learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Active learning methods play an important role to reduce the efforts of manual labeling in the field of machine learning. Although many active learning approaches have been proposed during the last years, most of them are restricted on binary or multi-class problems. One-class classifiers use samples from only one class, the so-called target class, during training and hence require special active learning strategies. The few strategies proposed for one-class classification either suffer from their limitation on specific one-class classifiers or their performance depends on particular assumptions about datasets like imbalance. Our proposed method bases on using two one-class classifiers, one for the desired target class and one for the so-called outlier class. It allows to invent new query strategies, to use binary query strategies and to define simple stopping criteria. Based on the new method, two query strategies are proposed. The provided experiments compare the proposed approach with known strategies on various datasets and show improved results in almost all situations. © EURASIP 2018.",,"European Signal Processing Conference, EUSIPCO"

Resource allocation across different parts of an organization, performing cross-validation splits of dataset with class imbalance, heterogeneous or mixed ability partitioning of students, etc. Are the applications of grouping which require each group to contain diverse set of patterns.

Analyzing this type of data entails difficulties for managing high-dimensional data, class imbalance for knowledge extraction, identifying important features and classifying individuals. In this study, we propose a general framework to tackle these challenges with different machine learning algorithms and techniques. We apply the configuration of this framework on lung cancer patients, identifying genetic signatures for classifying response to drug treatment response. We intersect these relevant SNPs with the GWAS Catalog of the National Human Genome Research Institute and explore the Regulomedb, GTEx databases for functional analysis purposes. Results: The machine learning based solution proposed in this study is a scalable and flexible alternative to the classical uni-variate regression approach to analyze large-scale data. From 36 experiments executed using the machine learning framework design, we obtain good classification performance from the top 5 models with the highest cross-validation score and the smallest standard deviation. One thousand two hundred twenty four SNPs corresponding to the key features from the top 20 models (cross validation F1 mean >= 0.65) were compared with the GWAS Catalog finding no intersection with genome-wide significant reported hits. From these, new genetic signatures in MAE, CEP104, PRKCZ and ADRB2 show relevant biological regulatory functionality related to lung physiology. Conclusions: We have defined a machine learning framework using data with an unbalanced large data-set of SNP-arrays and imputed genotyping data from a pharmacogenomics study in lung cancer patients subjected to first-line platinum-based treatment. This approach found genome signals with no genome-wide significance in the uni-variate regression approach (GWAS Catalog) that are valuable for classifying patients, only few of them with related biological function. The effect results of these variants can be explained by the recently proposed omnigenic model hypothesis, which states that complex traits can be influenced mostly by genes outside not only by the ""core genes"", mainly found by the genome-wide significant SNPs, but also by the rest of genes outside of the ""core pathways"" with apparent unrelated biological functionality. © 2018 The Author(s).","Classification; Feature selection; GWAS; Lung cancer; Machine learning","BioMed Central Ltd."

Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) is an effective, multivariate regression based method for spectral data classification. Although powerful, PLS-DA suffers from performance degradation under complex conditions such as nonlinearity, class imbalance and multiclass, which are common in real-world applications. Collaborative representation-based classifier (CRC) is a new machine learning algorithm which represents a query by a linear combination of training samples and classifies the query based on the representation. It offers the possibility of good classification performance even under nonlinearity, class imbalance and multiclass conditions. In this paper, we present a novel method for spectral data classification, namely CRC-WPLS, which reaps the benefits of both PLS regression and CRC. This method searches for a weighted, linear combination of all training samples to represent the query by using PLS regression, and then assigns the query to the class which yields the least approximation error. CRC-WPLS is compared to PLS-DA, kernel PLS-DA, support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF) and representation-based classifiers on fourteen general machine learning datasets and three spectral datasets. Experimental results show the proposed method can outperform 7 baseline methods in most cases, and achieve a high classification accuracy (>90%) for low grade spectra obtained from portable instrumentation. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Collaborative representation; Partial least squares; Spectral data","Elsevier B.V."

To better elucidate the molecular mechanism of S-sulfenylation, it is important to identify S-sulfenylated substrates and their corresponding S-sulfenylation sites accurately. In this study, a novel bioinformatics tool named Sulf_FSVM is proposed to predict S-sulfenylation sites by using multiple feature extraction and fuzzy support vector machine algorithm. On the one hand, amino acid factors, binary encoding, and the composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs features are incorporated to encode S-sulfenylation sites. And the maximum relevance minimum redundancy method are adopted to remove the redundant features. On the other hand, a fuzzy support vector machine algorithm is used to handle the class imbalance and noise problem in S-sulfenylation sites training dataset. As illustrated by 10-fold cross-validation, the performance of Sulf_FSVM achieves a satisfactory performance with a Sensitivity of 73.26%, a Specificity of 70.78%, an Accuracy of 71.07% and a Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.2971.

Existing classifications are effective at predicting GTR but are often hampered by limited discriminatory ability in moderate cases and by poor interrater agreement. Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, has recently established itself as highly effective in forecasting medical outcomes. In this pilot study, the authors aimed to evaluate the utility of using deep learning to predict GTR after transsphenoidal surgery for pituitary adenoma. METHODS Data from a prospective registry were used. The authors trained a deep neural network to predict GTR from 16 preoperatively available radiological and procedural variables. Class imbalance adjustment, cross-validation, and random dropout were applied to prevent overfitting and ensure robustness of the predictive model. The authors subsequently compared the deep learning model to a conventional logistic regression model and to the Knosp classification as a gold standard. RESULTS Overall, 140 patients who underwent endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery were included. GTR was achieved in 95 patients (68%), with a mean extent of resection of 96.8% ± 10.6%. Intraoperative high-field MRI was used in 116 (83%) procedures. The deep learning model achieved excellent area under the curve (AUC; 0.96), accuracy (91%), sensitivity (94%), and specificity (89%). This represents an improvement in comparison with the Knosp classification (AUC: 0.87, accuracy: 81%, sensitivity: 92%, specificity: 70%) and a statistically significant improvement in comparison with logistic regression (AUC: 0.86, accuracy: 82%, sensitivity: 81%, specificity: 83%) (all p < 0.001).

The dataset used in this study contains 297,113 vehicle crashes, obtained from the Michigan Traffic Crash Facts (MTCF) dataset, from 2016–2017. Similar to any other crash dataset, different accident severity classes are not equally represented in MTCF. To account for the imbalanced classes, several techniques have been used, including under-sampling and over-sampling. Using five classification learning models (i.e., Logistic regression, Decision tree, Neural network, Gradient boosting model, and Naïve Bayes classifier), we classify the levels of injury severity and attempt to improve the classification performance by two training-testing methods including Bootstrap aggregation (or bagging) and majority voting. Furthermore, due to the imbalance present in the dataset, we use the geometric mean (G-mean) to evaluate the classification performance. We show that the classification performance is the highest when bagging is used with decision trees, with over-sampling treatment for imbalanced data. The effect of treatments for the imbalanced data is maximized when under-sampling is combined with bagging. In addition to the original five classes of injury severity in the MTCF dataset, we consider two additional classification problems, one with two classes and the other with three classes, to (1) investigate the impact of the number of classes on the performance of classification models, and (2) enable comparing our results with the literature. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Automated vehicle safety; Data analytics; Imbalanced data; Injury severity classification; Machine learning; Vehicle crashes","Elsevier Ltd"

Sometimes, the imbalance in the number of samples of each class is very high and the interest is to classify the samples belonging to the minority class. Support vector machine (SVM) is one of the widely used techniques for classification problems which have been applied for solving this problem by using fuzzy based approach. In this paper, motivated by the work of Fan et al. (Knowledge-Based Systems 115: 87–99 2017), we have proposed two efficient variants of entropy based fuzzy SVM (EFSVM). By considering the fuzzy membership value for each sample, we have proposed an entropy based fuzzy least squares support vector machine (EFLSSVM-CIL) and entropy based fuzzy least squares twin support vector machine (EFLSTWSVM-CIL) for class imbalanced datasets where fuzzy membership values are assigned based on entropy values of samples. It solves a system of linear equations as compared to the quadratic programming problem (QPP) as in EFSVM. The least square versions of the entropy based SVM are faster than EFSVM and give higher generalization performance which shows its applicability and efficiency. Experiments are performed on various real world class imbalanced datasets and compared the results of proposed methods with new fuzzy twin support vector machine for pattern classification (NFTWSVM), entropy based fuzzy support vector machine (EFSVM), fuzzy twin support vector machine (FTWSVM) and twin support vector machine (TWSVM) which clearly illustrate the superiority of the proposed EFLSTWSVM-CIL. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Class imbalance; Fuzzy membership; Information entropy; K-nearest neighbour (K-NN); Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM)","Springer New York LLC"

This literature has long been dominated by variations of the same family of solutions (e.g. mainly resampling and cost-sensitive learning). Recently, a new and promising way of tackling this problem has been introduced: learning with scoring pairwise ranking so that each pair of classes contribute in tandem to the decision boundary. In this sense, the paper addresses the problem of class imbalance in the context of ordinal regression, proposing two novel contributions: (a) approaching the imbalance by binary pairwise ranking using a well-known label decomposition ensemble, and (b) introducing a regularization into this ensemble so that parallel decision boundaries are favored. These are two independent contributions that synergize well. Our model is tested using linear Support Vector Machines and our results are compared against state-of-the-art models.

The goal of this paper is to evaluate the possibility of using unobtrusively collected activity-aware smart home behavior data to detect the multimodal symptoms that are often found to be impaired in AD. After gathering longitudinal smart home data for 29 older adults over an average duration of >2 years, we automatically labeled the data with corresponding activity classes and extracted time-series statistics containing ten behavioral features. Mobility, cognition, and mood were evaluated every six months. Using these data, we created regression models to predict symptoms as measured by the tests and a feature selection analysis was performed. Classification models were built to detect reliable absolute changes in the scores predicting symptoms and SmoteBOOST and wRACOG algorithms were used to overcome class imbalance where needed. Results show that all mobility, cognition, and depression symptoms can be predicted from activity-aware smart home data. Similarly, these data can be effectively used to predict reliable changes in mobility and memory skills. Results also suggest that not all behavioral features contribute equally to the prediction of every symptom. Future work therefore can improve model sensitivity by including additional longitudinal data and by further improving strategies to extract relevant features and address class imbalance. The results presented herein contribute toward the development of an early change detection system based on smart home technology. © 2013 IEEE.","Activity recognition; Alzheimer's disease; automatic assessment; behavior; multimodal symptoms; older adults; smart homes","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

As a new and important direction in this field, multi-class imbalanced data classification has attracted a great many research focus in recent years. In this paper, we first make a very comprehensive review on state-of-the-art classification algorithms for multi-class imbalanced data. Moreover, we propose a new multi-class imbalance classification algorithm, which is hereafter referred to as the Diversified Error Correcting Output Codes (DECOC) method. The main idea of DECOC is to combine the improved ECOC (Error Correcting Output Codes) method for tackling class imbalance, and the diversified ensemble learning framework, which finds the best classification algorithm (out of many heterogeneous classification algorithms) for each individual sub-dataset resampled from the original data. We conduct experiments on 19 public datasets to empirically compare the performance of DECOC with 17 state-of-the-art multi-class imbalance learning algorithms, using 4 different accuracy measures: overall accuracy, Geometric mean, F-measure, and Area Under Curve. Experimental results demonstrate that DECOC achieves significantly better accuracy performance than the other 17 algorithms on these accuracy metrics.

However, real-world data comes with a myriad of challenges, amongst the most prominent of which is the fact that it can exhibit a high level of imbalance. This can come in the form of both within- and between-class imbalance. While a significant amount of research has been devoted to the impact of within-class imbalance over binary classifiers, very little attention has been given to their impact on one-class classifiers, which are typically used in situations of extreme between-class imbalance. During our collaboration with Health Canada into the identification of anomalous gamma-ray spectra, the issue of within-class imbalance in a one-class classification setting was highly significant. In this setting, the imbalance comes from the fact that the background data that we wish to model is composed of two concepts (background no-rain and rain); the rain sub-concept is rare and corresponds to spectra affected by the presence of water in the environment. In this article, we present our work into developing systems for detecting anomalous gamma-rays that are able to handle both the inherent between-class and within-class imbalance present in the domain. We test and validate our system over data provided to us by Health Canada from three sites across Canada. Our results indicated that oversampling the sub-concept improves the performance of the baseline classifiers and multiple classifier system when measured by the geometric mean of the per-class accuracy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Imbalanced data; Multiple classifier systems; One-class classification; Small disjuncts; Within-class imbalance","Elsevier Ltd"

While there is a significant number of works addressing the issue of handling binary and skewed datasets, its multi-class counterpart have not received as much attention. This problem is much more difficult, as presence of multiple imbalanced classes can significantly deteriorate the predictive power of any classifier. The relationship among classes are no longer clearly established and there are many difficulties embedded in the nature of such data that needs to be properly addressed. In this work, we discuss the issue of forming effective ensembles for multi-class imbalanced data based on static classifier selection approach. We propose a fully adaptive learning scheme that splits the original feature space into a number of competence areas and modifies their size and location in order to most effectively exploit the supplied pool of base classifiers. Additionally, for each established cluster we perform a weighted classifier combination, where weights are set individually for each cluster and each considered class. This allows for exploiting local competencies of each base learner in given part of feature space, as well as for each of considered classes. These two tasks are combined together in a single hybrid training scheme guided by an evolutionary algorithm. The optimization criterion is formulated in order to achieve skew-insensitive ensemble of local ensembles able to tackle highly imbalanced and multi-class problems. Experimental study proves the high efficacy of the proposed method and its superiority to other ensemble selection methods. © 2018 IEEE.","ensemble selection; imbalanced data; machine learning; multi-class imbalance","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Accumulated historical data collected from the working process of industrial machines are often imbalanced, which means the number of recorded observations in some classes are significantly scarcer than other classes. There are already various different methods addressing this problem, among which most strategies focus on generating similar data for the minority classes. Synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is an important and valid algorithm, which generates synthetic samples along the line segment, and a great many of variations have been proposed and proved effective. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) were originally invented to generate images from an adversarial training process. While SMOTE approaches are based on local information, GAN methods learn from the overall class distribution. In this paper, we proposed a deep convolutional GAN (DC GAN) model to simulate the original distribution from minority classes and generate new data to solve the imbalance problem. To verify the effectiveness of proposed DCGAN model, we compare the performance against multiple different resampling algorithms. The results show that the quality of generated data using DCGAN is significantly better than other oversampling method and therefore the classification accuracy is superior for fault diagnosis. © 2018 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.","Fault diagnosis; Generative adversarial networks; Imbalanced dataset","IEEE Computer Society"

Most of the medical databases have heterogeneous features with different levels of severity patterns. Feature extraction and classification of high risk patterns may have potential benefits for decision making. In the medical applications, data classification algorithms are used to detect the disease severity that can help in early prediction of new type of disease patterns. Also, machine learning algorithms are more accurate, high true positive rate and reliable for heterogeneous features. Traditional classification models such as Naïve Bayes, SVM, Feed forward neural networks, Regression models, etc are used to classify the homogeneous disease datasets with limited feature space. As the size of the Alzheimer's disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are failed to process the disease patterns due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient classification model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is essential with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, a novel feature selection based classification model is proposed to improve the disease classification rate and testing the new type of disease patterns for real-time patient disease prediction. In the proposed model, a novel probabilistic based feature selection measure for classification algorithm is designed and implemented for real-time patient disease prediction using the training datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed feature selection based classification algorithm is better than the traditional algorithms in terms of true positive rate, error rate and F-measure are concerned. © 2018 IEEE.","Alzheimer disease; Decision tree; Ensemble classification; Feature selection; SVM","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The problem is getting harder when the dataset has multiclass target and the number of samples in each class is not well distributed (which is called imbalance data distribution). In this research, two different approaches to handle imbalance data distribution are studied, they are SMOTE (based on data approach) and weighted ELM (based on algorithmic approach). To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, two public imbalanced multiclass microarray dataset are used, GCM (Global Cancer Map) and Subtypes-Leukemia dataset. The results of experiment show that the implementation of SMOTE and weighted ELM on GCM dataset have no significant effect in the classification performance. Different with the Subtypes-Leukemia dataset, the implementation of SMOTE and weighted ELM has improved the classification performance compared to the previous research.

An additional objective was to publicly release manually annotated data. Materials and Methods We organized 3 independent subtasks: Automatic classification of self-reports of 1) adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and 2) medication consumption, from medication-mentioning tweets, and 3) normalization of ADR expressions. Training data consisted of 15 717 annotated tweets for (1), 10 260 for (2), and 6650 ADR phrases and identifiers for (3); and exhibited typical properties of social-media-based health-related texts. Systems were evaluated using 9961, 7513, and 2500 instances for the 3 subtasks, respectively. We evaluated performances of classes of methods and ensembles of system combinations following the shared tasks. Results Among 55 system runs, the best system scores for the 3 subtasks were 0.435 (ADR class F 1-score) for subtask-1, 0.693 (micro-Averaged F 1-score over two classes) for subtask-2, and 88.5% (accuracy) for subtask-3. Ensembles of system combinations obtained best scores of 0.476, 0.702, and 88.7%, outperforming individual systems. Discussion Among individual systems, support vector machines and convolutional neural networks showed high performance. Performance gains achieved by ensembles of system combinations suggest that such strategies may be suitable for operational systems relying on difficult text classification tasks (eg, subtask-1).

However, detected candidates include many false positives and thus in the following stage, false positive reduction, such false positives are reliably reduced. Note that this task is challenging due to 1) the imbalance between the numbers of nodules and non-nodules and 2) the intra-class diversity of non-nodules. Although techniques using 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising performance, they suffer from high computational complexity which hinders constructing deep networks. To efficiently address these problems, we propose a novel framework using the ensemble of 2D CNNs using single views, which outperforms existing 3D CNN-based methods. Methods: Our ensemble of 2D CNNs utilizes single-view 2D patches to improve both computational and memory efficiency compared to previous techniques exploiting 3D CNNs. We first categorize non-nodules on the basis of features encoded by an autoencoder. Then, all 2D CNNs are trained by using the same nodule samples, but with different types of non-nodules. By extending the learning capability, this training scheme resolves difficulties of extracting representative features from non-nodules with large appearance variations. Note that, instead of manual categorization requiring the heavy workload of radiologists, we propose to automatically categorize non-nodules based on the autoencoder and k-means clustering. Results: We performed extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our framework based on the database of the lung nodule analysis 2016 challenge. The superiority of our framework is demonstrated through comparing the performance of five frameworks trained with differently constructed training sets. Our proposed framework achieved state-of-the-art performance (0.922 of the competition performance metric score) with low computational demands (789K of parameters and 1024M of floating point operations per second). Conclusion: We presented a novel false positive reduction framework, the ensemble of single-view 2D CNNs with fully automatic non-nodule categorization, for pulmonary nodule detection. Unlike previous 3D CNN-based frameworks, we utilized 2D CNNs using 2D single views to improve computational efficiency. Also, our training scheme using categorized non-nodules, extends the learning capability of representative features of different non-nodules. Our framework achieved state-of-the-art performance with low computational complexity. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Automatic non-nodule categorization; Computer-aided detection; Deep learning; False positive reduction; Pulmonary nodule detection","Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

Prediction of novel drugs and targets helps in identifying optimal drug therapies for various stringent diseases. Computational prediction of drug-target interactions can help to identify potential drug-target pairs and speed-up the process of drug repositioning. In our present, work we have focused on machine learning algorithms for predicting drug-target interactions from the pool of existing drug-target data. The key idea is to train the classifier using existing DTI so as to predict new or unknown DTI. However, there are various challenges such as class imbalance and high dimensional nature of data that need to be addressed before developing optimal drug-target interaction model. Methods: In this paper, we propose a bagging based ensemble framework named BE-DTI’ for drug-target interaction prediction using dimensionality reduction and active learning to deal with class-imbalanced data. Active learning helps to improve under-sampling bagging based ensembles. Dimensionality reduction is used to deal with high dimensional data. Results: Results show that the proposed technique outperforms the other five competing methods in 10-fold cross-validation experiments in terms of AUC=0.927, Sensitivity=0.886, Specificity=0.864, and G-mean=0.874. Conclusion: Missing interactions and new interactions are predicted using the proposed framework. Some of the known interactions are removed from the original dataset and their interactions are recalculated to check the accuracy of the proposed framework. Moreover, validation of the proposed approach is performed using the external dataset.

Liver vessel segmentation is difficult due to the complex vessel structures, and even expert manual annotations contain unlabeled vessels. This paper presents an automatic liver vessel extraction method using deep convolutional network and studies the impact of incomplete data annotation on segmentation accuracy evaluation. Methods: We select the 3D U-Net and use data augmentation for accurate liver vessel extraction with few training samples and incomplete labeling. To deal with high imbalance between foreground (liver vessel) and background (liver) classes but also increase segmentation accuracy, a loss function based on a variant of the dice coefficient is proposed to increase the penalties for misclassified voxels. We include unlabeled liver vessels extracted by our method in the expert manual annotations, with a specialist's visual inspection for refinement, and compare the evaluations before and after the procedure. Results: Experiments were performed on the public datasets Sliver07 and 3Dircadb as well as local clinical datasets. The average dice and sensitivity for the 3Dircadb dataset were 67.5% and 74.3%, respectively, prior to annotation refinement, as compared with 75.3% and 76.7% after refinement. Conclusions: The proposed method is automatic, accurate and robust for liver vessel extraction with high noise and varied vessel structures. It can be used for liver surgery planning and rough annotation of new datasets. The evaluation difference based on some benchmarks, and their refined results, showed that the quality of annotation should be further considered for supervised learning methods. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","3D U-Net; Annotation quality; Liver vessel extraction; Refined manual expert annotations; Variant dice loss function","Elsevier Ltd"

Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, MNIST, CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of CNNs; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Class imbalance; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Image classification","Elsevier Ltd"

It has been applied in various real world applications due to its less computational complexity. In most of the applications on classification, there is imbalance in the number of samples of the classes which leads to incorrect classification of the data points of the minority class. Further, while dealing with imbalanced data, noise poses a major challenge in various applications. To resolve these problems, in this paper we propose a robust fuzzy least squares twin support vector machine for class imbalance learning termed as RFLSTSVM-CIL using 2-norm of the slack variables which makes the optimization problem strongly convex. In order to reduce the effect of outliers, we propose a novel fuzzy membership function specifically for class imbalance problems. Our proposed function gives the appropriate weights to the datasets and also incorporates the knowledge about the imbalance ratio of the data. In our proposed model, a pair of system of linear equations is solved instead of solving a quadratic programming problem (QPP) which makes our model efficient in terms of computation complexity.

In this context, several models for readmission risk prediction have been proposed in recent years. The goal of this review is to give an overview of prediction models for hospital readmission, describe the data analysis methods and algorithms used for building the models, and synthesize their results. Methods: Studies that reported the predictive performance of a model for hospital readmission risk were included. We defined the scope of the review and accordingly built a search query to select the candidate papers. This query string was used as input for the chosen search engines, namely PubMed and Google Scholar. For each study, we recorded the population, feature selection method, classification algorithm, sample size, readmission threshold, readmission rate and predictive performance of the model. Results: We identified 77 studies that met the inclusion criteria, out of 265 citations. In 68% of the studies (n = 52) logistic regression or other regression techniques were utilized as the main method. Ten (13%) studies used survival analysis for model construction, while 14 (18%) used machine learning techniques for classification, of which decision tree-based methods and SVM were the most utilized algorithms. Among these, only four studies reported the use of any class imbalance addressing technique, of which resampling is the most frequent (75%). The performance of the models varied significantly among studies, with Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) values in the ranges between 0.54 and 0.92. Conclusion: Logistic regression and survival analysis have been traditionally the most widely used techniques for model building. Nevertheless, machine learning techniques are becoming increasingly popular in recent years. Recent comparative studies suggest that machine learning techniques can improve prediction ability over traditional statistical approaches. Regardless, the lack of an appropriate benchmark dataset of hospital readmissions makes a comparison of models’ performance across different studies difficult. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",,"Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

For this purpose, it introduces a multi-linear feature space (MLFS) based on a quasi-linear kernel, which is composed from a pretrained neural network (NN). By using the quasi-linear kernel, the proposed MLFS oversampling method avoids computing directly the Euclidean distances among the samples when oversampling the minority class and mapping the samples to high-dimensional feature space, which makes it easy to be applied to classification of high-dimensional datasets. On the other hand, by using kernel learning instead of representation learning using the NN, it makes an unsupervised learning, even a transfer learning, to be easily employed for the pretraining of NNs because a kernel is usually less dependent on a specific problem, which makes it possible to avoid considering the imbalance problem at the stage of pretraining the NN. Finally, a method is developed to oversample the synthetic minority samples by computing the quasi-linear kernel matrix instead of computing very high dimensional MLFS feature vectors directly. The proposed MLFS oversampling method is applied to different real-world datasets including image dataset, and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2018 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

Supervised anti-spam filters using machine-learning methods have been particularly effective in categorizing spam and non-spam messages. These automatically integrate spam corpora pre-processing, appropriate word lists selection, and the calculation of word weights, usually in a bag-of-words fashion. To develop an accurate spam filter is challenging because spammers attempt to decrease the probability of spam detection by using legitimate words. Complex models are therefore needed to solve such a problem. However, existing spam filtering methods usually converge to a poor local minimum, cannot effectively handle high-dimensional data and suffer from overfitting issues. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel spam filter integrating an N-gram tf.idf feature selection, modified distribution-based balancing algorithm and a regularized deep multi-layer perceptron NN model with rectified linear units (DBB-RDNN-ReL). As demonstrated on four benchmark spam datasets (Enron, SpamAssassin, SMS spam collection and Social networking), the proposed approach enables capturing more complex features from high-dimensional data by additional layers of neurons. Another advantage of this approach is that no additional dimensionality reduction is necessary and spam dataset imbalance is addressed using a modified distribution-based algorithm. We compare the performance of the approach with that of state-of-the-art spam filters (Minimum Description Length, Factorial Design using SVM and NB, Incremental Learning C4.5, and Random Forest, Voting and Convolutional Neural Network) and several machine learning algorithms commonly used to classify text. We show that the proposed model outperforms these other methods in terms of classification accuracy, with fewer false negatives and false positives. Notably, the proposed spam filter classifies both major (legitimate) and minor (spam) classes well on personalized / non-personalized and balanced / imbalanced spam datasets. In addition, we show that the proposed model performs better than the results reported by previous studies in terms of accuracy.

These metrics select effective features from a traffic flow. However, in order to select robust features from the selected features, we proposed robust features selection algorithm.

Recognition of trigger words is a very important first step for event extraction, since the following extraction steps depends on the outputting trigger words. The application of event trigger recognition aims to classify different kinds of trigger words from very large biomedical literature data sets with significant imbalance between classes. However, many existing classification methods show great limitations and performance decline on imbalanced and large data sets. In this paper, a selective under-sampling based bagging Support Vector Machine, SUS Bagging-SVM, approach has been proposed to address the issues together in an ensemble learning framework. Through making use of boundary information, a novel selective under-sampling method was designed to prune unimportant instances from the majority class to reduce imbalance in large data sets effectively. SUS Bagging-SVM was tested on the corpus of BioNLP’09 shared task. It achieved a total F1-measure of 66.1, which is competitive in comparison with other state-of-art trigger recognition systems, and a higher recall value. In conclusion, SUS Bagging-SVM is a valuable method for alleviating the problem of classification on imbalanced and large data. © 2018 ACM.","Ensemble learning; Event trigger recognition; Imbalanced large data set; Under-sampling","Association for Computing Machinery"

The imbalance class is a state in which the classification results give the number of instances in a class much larger than the number of instances in the other class. In machine learning, this problem can reduce the prediction accuracy and also reduce the quality of the resulting decisions. One of the most popular methods of dealing with class imbalance is the method of ensemble learning. Hybrid Ensembles is an ensemble learning method approach that combines the use of bagging and boosting. Optimization of Hybrid Ensembles is done with the intent to reduce the number of classifier and also obtain better data diversity. Based on an iterative methodology, we review, analyze, and synthesize the current state of the literature and propose a completely new research framework for optimizing Hybrid Ensembles. In doing so, we propose a new taxonomy in ensemble learning that yields a new approach of sampling-based Ensembles and will propose an optimization Hybrid Ensembles using Hybrid Approach Redefinition (HAR) Model that combines the use of Hybrid Ensembles and Sampling Based Ensembles methods.

An analysis of real-world electronic health record (EHR) data has revealed that a patient could be diagnosed as having more than one disease simultaneously. Therefore, to suggest a list of possible diseases, the task of classifying patients is transferred into a multi-label learning task. For most multi-label learning techniques, the class imbalance that exists in EHR data may bring about performance degradation. Cross-Coupling Aggregation (COCOA) is a typical multi-label learning approach that is aimed at leveraging label correlation and exploring class imbalance. For each label, COCOA aggregates the predictive result of a binary-class imbalance classifier corresponding to this label as well as the predictive results of some multi-class imbalance classifiers corresponding to the pairs of this label and other labels. However, class imbalance may still affect a multi-class imbalance learner when the number of a coupling label is too small. To improve the performance of COCOA, a regularized ensemble approach integrated into a multi-class classification process of COCOA named as COCOA-RE is presented in this paper. To provide disease diagnosis, COCOA-RE learns from the available laboratory test reports and essential information of patients and produces a multi-label predictive model. Experiments were performed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-label learning approach, and the proposed approach was implemented in a developed system prototype. © 2018 by the authors.","Clinical decision support system (CDSS); Decision-making; Electronic health records (EHRs); Multi-label learning","MDPI AG"

Then, a subset of the selected classifiers is chosen for each test sample as the dynamic ensemble selection.

Conventional ELM does not take into account the class imbalance problem effectively. Numerous variants of ELM-like weighted ELM (WELM), Boosting WELM (BWELM) etc. have been proposed in order to diminish the performance degradation which happens due to the class imbalance problem. This work proposed a novel Reduced Kernelized WELM (RKWELM) which is a variant of kernelized WELM to handle the class imbalance problem more effectively. The performance of RKWELM varies due to the arbitrary selection of the kernel centroids. To reduce this variation, this work uses ensemble method. The computational complexity of kernelized ELM (KELM) is subject to the number of kernels. KELM generally employ Gaussian kernel function. It employs all of the training instances to act as the centroid. This will lead to computation of the pseudoinverse of N×N matrix. Here, N represents the number of training instances. This operation becomes very slow for the large values of N. Moreover, for the imbalanced classification problems, using all the training instances as the centroid will result in more number of centroids representing the majority class compared to the centroids representing the minority class. This might lead to biased classification model, which favors the majority class instances. So, this work uses a subset of the training instances as the centroid of the kernels. RKWELM arbitrarily chooses Nmin instances from each class which acts as the centroid. The total number of centroids will be N˜=m×Nmin. Here, m represents the number of classes and Nmin is the number of instances belonging to the minority class which has the least number of instances. This reduction in the number of kernels will lead to reduced kernel matrix of size, N˜×N˜ leading to decrease in the computational complexity. This work creates a number of balanced kernel subsets depending on the degree of class imbalance. A number of RKWELM based classification models are produced utilizing these balanced kernel subsets. The ultimate outcome is computed by the majority voting and the soft voting of these classification models. The proposed algorithm is assessed by using the benchmark real-world imbalanced datasets downloaded from the KEEL dataset repository. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the proposed work in contrast with the rest of classifiers for the imbalanced classification problems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Class imbalance problem; Classification; Kernelized extreme learning machine; UnderBagging ensemble; Voting methods","Elsevier Ltd"

An overlapped grouping strategy with biological interpretability is proposed, which highlights the importance of gene groups from the minority classes. By using the conditional mutual information, the gene significance within each group is evaluated and the data-driven weights are constructed. Based on the grouping strategy and constructed weights, a regularized adaptive multinomial regression is presented and the solving algorithm is developed, which can not only select the important gene groups for each class in performing multi-class classification, but also adaptively select important genes within each group.

Through its structural risk minimization, it has enjoyed a good reputation in effectively reducing overfitting, avoiding dimensional disaster, and not falling into local minima. Nevertheless, existing SVMs do not perform well when facing class imbalance and large-scale samples. Undersampling is a plausible alternative to solve imbalanced problems in some way, but suffers from soaring computational complexity and reduced accuracy because of its enormous iterations and random sampling process. To improve their classification performance in dealing with data imbalance problems, this work proposes a weighted undersampling (WU) scheme for SVM based on space geometry distance, and thus produces an improved algorithm named WU-SVM. In WU-SVM, majority samples are grouped into some subregions (SRs) and assigned different weights according to their Euclidean distance to the hyper plane. The samples in an SR with higher weight have more chance to be sampled and put to use in each learning iteration, so as to retain the data distribution information of original data sets as much as possible. Comprehensive experiments are performed to test WU-SVM via 21 binary-class and six multiclass publically available data sets.

This phenomenon has been named software aging, which is caused by aging-related bugs (ARBs). Testing resource allocation can be optimized by identifying ARB-prone modules with ARB prediction. However, due to the low presence and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, it is usually hard to collect sufficient training data to carry out within-project ARB prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach named transfer learning based aging-related bug prediction (TLAP) to perform cross-project ARB prediction. TLAP first takes advantage of transfer learning to reduce distribution difference between training and testing project. Then, class imbalance learning is conducted to mitigate the severe class imbalance between ARB-prone and ARB-free modules. Finally, machine learning methods are used to handle bug prediction tasks. The effectiveness of this approach is validated and evaluated by nine groups of experiments on real software systems. Major conclusions from the experiments include the following: first, TLAP improves cross-project ARB prediction on average compared with traditional machine learning methods; second, utilizing information from multiple-projects can further improve the prediction performance on average. In the best case, it outperforms within-project prediction; third, the number of ARB-prone files and distribution similarity can influence TLAP performance.

Existing learning algorithms maximise the classification accuracy by correctly classifying the majority class, but misclassify the minority class. The challenge lies in that the minority class instances represent the data of greater interest than the majority class instances in real-life applications. Recently, several techniques based on sampling methods (under-sampling and oversampling of the majority and minority class respectively), cost-sensitive learning methods, and ensemble learning have been used in the literature for classifying imbalanced datasets. In this paper, we present a new clustering-based under-sampling approach with boosting (AdaBoost) algorithm, called CUSBoost, for effective imbalanced classification. The proposed algorithm provides an alternative to RUSBoost (random under-sampling with AdaBoost) and SMOTEBoost (synthetic minority oversampling with AdaBoost) algorithms. We evaluated the performance of the CUSBoost algorithm against the state-of-the-art methods based on ensemble learning like AdaBoost, RUSBoost, SMOTEBoost on 13 imbalanced binary and multi-class datasets with various imbalance ratios.

The contribution of our work is to show that good classification performance on big data, across different application domains, can be achieved without too much alteration to the original dataset. In order to demonstrate good classification performance with big data, we process four datasets, from different domains, generating several imbalanced variants. Five new imbalanced big datasets, with target positive classes of 10%, 1%, 0.1%, 0.01%, and 0.001%, were created from each original full dataset to study information loss introduced in traditional random undersampling. Random undersampling is applied to balance the binary class in each of the created imbalance datasets generating 50:50 class ratios. All models were built using the Random Forest classifier, using the Spark and H2O machine learning libraries, and performance was recorded to find good ratios for undersampling big data without discarding too much of the majority class. We provide a comparison of all models created from the prepared datasets, generating 4,488 models. We conclude that, in terms of imbalanced data, from 0.1% to 1.0% of the minority class, adequate performance is obtained even when compared to 10% or even 100% of the full balanced data set. Moreover, when random undersampling the negative class to 50:50, there are similarities regarding the average performance compared to that of using the entire big dataset. © 2018 IEEE.","Apache spark; Big data; H2O; Imbalanced data; Machine learning; Random forest; Random undersampling","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

This method establishes the ensemble classifier in bagging framework, and the weight extreme learning machine algorithm is selected to build the basic classifiers. Defining adjustable oversampling rate formula, the diversity of basic classifiers is ensured by oversampling the minority data with SMOTE method.

This mainly refers to the problem where the number of samples in certain classes is much greater than in others. Such imbalance considerably affects the performance of classifiers in which the majority class or classes are often favored, thus resulting in high-precision/low-recall classifiers. Named entity recognition in free text suffers from this problem to a large extent because in any given free text, many samples do not belong to a specific entity. Furthermore, the data used in this specific type of classification is in sequenced mode and is different than that used in other common classification tasks such as image classification, spam detection, and text classification in which no semantic or syntactic relation exists between samples. In this study, we propose an undersampling approach for sequenced data that preserves existing correlations between sequenced samples that comprise sentences and thus improve the performance of classifiers.

It is useful in balancing the datasets so that minority class can be identified with high accuracy without affecting accuracy of majority class. New synthetic data is generated using this method to achieve balance ratio. Testing has been done on five benchmark datasets using two standard classifiers KNN and C4.5. The evaluation matrix on precision, recall and fmeasure are drawn for two standard classification algorithms. It is observed that Hellinger distance reduces risk of overlapping and skewness of data. Obtained results show increase of 20% in classification accuracy compared to classification of imbalance multi-class dataset. © 2017 IEEE.","Class imbalance problem; Classification; Hellinger distance; Multi-class; Oversampling","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Traditionally, detection of Botnets from network data using machine learning approaches is framed as an offline, supervised learning activity. However, in practice both normal behaviours and Botnet behaviours represent non-stationary processes in which there are continuous developments to both as new services/applications and malicious behaviours appear. This work formulates the task of Botnet detection as a streaming data task in which finite label budgets, class imbalance and incremental/online learning predominate. We demonstrate that effective Botnet detection is possible for label budgets as low as 0.5% when an active learning approach is adopted for genetic programming (GP) streaming data analysis.

Dataset used consists of 2664 accidents with four severity levels and twenty five explanatory variables belonging to seven highways in state of Haryana, India. As there was an imbalance in crashes by injury level with the available dataset, two approaches for class balancing: synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE) and randomise class balancing were used. Analysis of results suggests a significant improvement in predicting injury severity after class balancing. A comparison of results provided by used approaches suggests a superior performance by random forest classifier in terms of classification of accident severity levels. Another advantage of the use of random forest classifier is the availability of a ranked list of all input variables during classification of injury severity, which can be used to identify important variables required for classification of accident data in different severity levels. Analysis of results reveals that in order to reduce fatal and severe accidents, more attention needs to be provided to local and vulnerable road user traffic entering and crossing the highways in hazardous situations. The contribution of side swipe crashes and crashes with parked vehicles in severe outcomes was found to be another area of concern, requiring enforcement of lane discipline on highways and construction of lay-by bays as per the requirement of traffic. © 2018, Gioacchino Onorati Editore.

In a bankruptcy dataset, the problem of class imbalance, in which the number of bankruptcy companies is smaller than the number of normal companies, leads to a standard classification algorithm that does not work well. Therefore, this study proposes a cluster-based boosting algorithm as well as a robust framework using the CBoost algorithm and Instance Hardness Threshold (RFCI) for effective bankruptcy prediction of a financial dataset. This framework first resamples the imbalance dataset by the undersampling method using Instance Hardness Threshold (IHT), which is used to remove the noise instances having large IHT value in the majority class. Then, this study proposes a Cluster-based Boosting algorithm, namely CBoost, for dealing with the class imbalance. In this algorithm, the majority class will be clustered into a number of clusters. The distance from each sample to its closest centroid will be used to initialize its weight. This algorithm will perform several iterations for finding weak classifiers and combining them to create a strong classifier. The resample set resulting from the previous module, will be used to train CBoost, which will be used to predict bankruptcy for the validation set. The proposed framework is verified by the Korean bankruptcy dataset (KBD), which has a very small balancing ratio in both the training and the testing phases. The experimental results of this research show that the proposed framework achieves 86.8% in AUC (area under the ROC curve) and outperforms several methods for dealing with the imbalanced data problem for bankruptcy prediction such as GMBoost algorithm, the oversampling-based method using SMOTEENN, and the clustering-based undersampling method for bankruptcy prediction in the experimental dataset. © 2018 by the author.","Bankruptcy prediction; Cluster-based boosting; Machine learning; Undersampling technique","MDPI AG"

The individual labels of the instances within a bag are unknown, and labels are assigned based on a multi-instance assumption. One of the major complexities associated with this type of learning is the ambiguous relationship between a bag's label and the instances it contains. This paper proposes a novel support vector machine (SVM) multiple-instance formulation and presents an algorithm with a bag-representative selector that trains the SVM based on bag-level information, named MIRSVM. The contribution is able to identify instances that highly impact classification, i.e. bag-representatives, for both positive and negative bags, while finding the optimal class separation hyperplane. Unlike other multi-instance SVM methods, this approach eliminates possible class imbalance issues by allowing both positive and negative bags to have at most one representative, which constitute as the most contributing instances to the model. The experimental study evaluates and compares the performance of this proposal against 11 state-of-the-art multi-instance methods over 15 datasets, and the results are validated through non-parametric statistical analysis. The results indicate that bag-based learners outperform the instance-based and wrapper methods, as well as MIRSVM's overall superior performance against other multi-instance SVM models, having an average accuracy of 82.6%, which is 2.5% better than the best performing state-of-the-art MI classifier. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bag-level multi-instance classification; Bag-representative selection; Machine learning; Multiple-instance learning; Support vector machines","Elsevier Ltd"

Deep learning has demonstrated some remarkable success through its capacity to create detailed (deep) models of complex multivariate in structured data. Deep learning can be characterized in several different ways, but the most important that deep learning can learn higher-order interactions among features using a cascade of many layers. Despite the successful breakthrough of deep learning, it still faces big challenges in computation complexity with hyper-parameter and time-consuming process to calculate many fully connected layers. We propose an alternate way to learn deep learning model in imbalance dataset. We incorporate ensemble models to learn every class target (user rating) with one base deep learning classifier models from user comments, in this way we will learn every rating with its fitting model. The main idea for ensemble model is to give an alternate solution for base classifiers to select the best results. In ensemble model, we could use different feature selection for input layer. Using all features in the same model could cause computation complexity and make the running process consume much time. Also, some features could be assessed whether significant or not. Less significant feature later could be prune in classifier or could be substituted with other features which are extracted from sampling data. This classification is based on two dimensions: how predictions are combined (rule-based and Meta-learning) and how the learning process is done (parallel or sequential). In rule-based approach, predictions will be combined using rule to average the performance. Meta-learning techniques use predictions from component classifiers as features for a Meta-learning model. In output layer, we apply voting methods to select user rating as output from each base classifier to generate user rating predicting results with more extensive results. © 2018 IEEE.","Deep Learning; Imbalance Classification; User Rating Prediction","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Specifically, we formulate conditional generative adversarial networks and the general Softmax classifier into a unified framework. Such a two-player minimax optimization can guide the generation of more effective data, which benefit the classifier learning for one-shot classes. The experimental results on a large-scale face benchmark with 21K persons verify the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in one-shot classification, as our generative model significantly improves the recognition coverage rate from 25:65% to 94:84% at the precision of 99% for the one-shot classes, while still keeps an overall Top-1 accuracy at 99:80% for the normal classes. © 2018 IEEE.","Face recognition; Generative model; One shot learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The weighted extreme learning machine (WELM) was proposed. It solved the L2-regularized weighted least squares problem in order to avoid the generation of an over-fitting model and to obtain better classification performances in imbalanced data sets when compared with extreme learning machine. While a WELM algorithm can address class imbalance issues, the random assignment of input parameters and the training sample weights generated according to class distribution of training data have been found to affect the performance of WELM. The aim of this study was to propose a self-adaptive differential evolutionary weighted extreme learning machine (SDE-WELM) which utilized a self-adaptive differential evolutionary to find the optimal input weights, hidden node parameters, and training sample weights of the WELM and exploit an appropriate criterion to be used as the fitness function for binary imbalance learning.

Since all candidate drugs cannot be tested with animal and clinical trials, in vitro approaches are first attempted to identify promising candidates. Likewise, identifying different causal relations between biomedical entities is also critical to understand biomedical processes. Generally, natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning are used to predict specific relations between any given pair of entities using the distant supervision approach. Objective: To build high accuracy supervised predictive models to predict previously unknown treatment and causative relations between biomedical entities based only on semantic graph pattern features extracted from biomedical knowledge graphs. Methods: We used 7000 treats and 2918 causes hand-curated relations from the UMLS Metathesaurus to train and test our models. Our graph pattern features are extracted from simple paths connecting biomedical entities in the SemMedDB graph (based on the well-known SemMedDB database made available by the U.S. National Library of Medicine). Using these graph patterns connecting biomedical entities as features of logistic regression and decision tree models, we computed mean performance measures (precision, recall, F-score) over 100 distinct 80–20% train-test splits of the datasets. For all experiments, we used a positive:negative class imbalance of 1:10 in the test set to model relatively more realistic scenarios. Results: Our models predict treats and causes relations with high F-scores of 99% and 90% respectively. Logistic regression model coefficients also help us identify highly discriminative patterns that have an intuitive interpretation. We are also able to predict some new plausible relations based on false positives that our models scored highly based on our collaborations with two physician co-authors. Finally, our decision tree models are able to retrieve over 50% of treatment relations from a recently created external dataset. Conclusions: We employed semantic graph patterns connecting pairs of candidate biomedical entities in a knowledge graph as features to predict treatment/causative relations between them. We provide what we believe is the first evidence in direct prediction of biomedical relations based on graph features. Our work complements lexical pattern based approaches in that the graph patterns can be used as additional features for weakly supervised relation prediction. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Information extraction; Relation prediction; Semantic graph patterns","Academic Press Inc."

One of its more challenging sub-domains is word sense disambiguation, the task of automatically identifying the intended sense (or concept) of an ambiguous word based on the context in which the word is used. This requires proper feature extraction to capture specific data properties and a dedicated machine learning solution to allow for the accurate labeling of the appropriate sense. However, the pattern classification problem posed here is highly challenging, as we must deal with high-dimensional and multi-class imbalanced data that additionally may be corrupted with class label noise.

The classifiers are trained on the basis of low-dimensional subsets of features and a kernel feature space transformation to obtain a more compact representation. Instance weighting is used to filter out potentially noisy instances and reduce overlapping among classes. Finally, a two-level classifier fusion technique is used to reconstruct the original multi-class problem.

As an effective and efficient solution, cost-sensitive learning has been widely adopted to address class imbalance learning (CIL) problems. Weighted extreme learning machine (WELM), which is constructed based on ELM, is a significant member in the cost-sensitive-learning algorithmic family. WELM can effectively deal with CIL problems. However, it has two main drawbacks: 1) it has high time complexity on large-scale data since a large-matrix multiplication operation is required in the solution procedure and 2) it lacks flexibility since it can only tune the training error for each instance and not for each class label. In this paper, we present an alternative to WELM, which is called label-WELM (LW-ELM). Unlike WELM, LW-ELM copes with CIL problems by tuning the training error of each class label. Specifically, the expected output (or training class label) that corresponds to the minority class is augmented, thereby providing stronger tolerance to training errors of the minority-class instances. In this paper, we design two types of weight allocation strategies, both of which are based on the class-imbalance ratio (CIR). In contrast with WELM, LW-ELM is fast and flexible, where fast means that it has low-time complexity and flexible indicates that it can also be used to tackle imbalanced multi-label learning problems, while WELM cannot. The experimental results on binary-class, multiclass, and multi-label data sets with skewed class distributions show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed LW-ELM algorithm. © 2013 IEEE.","Class imbalance learning; cost-sensitive learning; extreme learning machine; multi-label learning; weighted extreme learning machine","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Second, a group of different component classifiers are to learn the decision boundary between the minority and the majority classes for each training subset. A stacking model is applied to separate the minority class from the majority one, where the result produced by each classifier is taken as a feature to train a meta classifier. Comparison experiments are conducted based on 17 datasets from UCI machine learning repository.

However, the real world data often suffer from class imbalance. Dealing with multi-class tasks with different misclassification costs of classes is harder than dealing with two-class ones. Undersampling and oversampling are two of the most popular data preprocessing techniques dealing with imbalanced data-sets. Ensemble classifiers have been shown to be more effective than data sampling techniques to enhance the classification performance of imbalanced data. Moreover, the combination of ensemble learning with sampling methods to tackle the class imbalance problem has led to several proposals in the literature, with positive results. The ensemble margin is a fundamental concept in ensemble learning. Several studies have shown that the generalization performance of an ensemble classifier is related to the distribution of its margins on the training examples. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble margin based algorithm, which handles imbalanced classification by employing more low margin examples which are more informative than high margin samples. This algorithm combines ensemble learning with undersampling, but instead of balancing classes randomly such as UnderBagging, our method pays attention to constructing higher quality balanced sets for each base classifier. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling class imbalanced data, UnderBagging and SMOTEBagging are used in a comparative analysis. In addition, we also compare the performances of different ensemble margin definitions, including both supervised and unsupervised margins, in class imbalance learning. © 2018 by the authors.","Classification; Ensemble learning; Ensemble margin; Imbalance learning; Multi-class","MDPI AG"

Binary Relevance (BR), which comes from the idea of one-vs-all for multi-class classification, is a representative algorithm for multi-label learning. It ignores label correlations and may suffer the class-imbalance problem. However, BR is mostly implemented by decomposing into many independent binary classifiers and learning each individually, making it difficult to extend. Moreover, when extending BR by learning together, the mostly used least squared loss function is more suitable for a regression task rather than a classification task. In this paper, we propose a unified framework implementing linear BR for multi-label learning, which is easy to extend and can also be applied in one-vs-all for multi-class classification. We mainly focus on five popular convex loss functions. Experimental results show that the unified framework achieves competitive performances than traditional implementations and some other well-established algorithms for both multi-label learning and multi-class classification.

Developing a model based decision support system with such unbalanced datasets is a cause of concern and it is indeed necessary to have a model predicting the disease quite accurately because most of the conventional machine learning algorithms are showing very poor performance to classify the skewed distribution data i.e., whether a patient is affected by malaria disease or not because in imbalanced data, majority (unaffected) class samples are dominates the minority (affected) class samples which leading to class imbalance problem.

Four different datasets that are directly (cholestasis) or indirectly (via inhibition of organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 and 1B3) related to liver toxicity were chosen for this purpose. The imbalance ratio in these datasets ranges between 4:1 and 20:1 for negative and positive classes, respectively. Three different sets of molecular descriptors for model development were used, and their performance was assessed in 10-fold cross-validation and on an independent validation set.

To cope with the skewed class distribution, many learning methods featuring minority oversampling have been proposed, which are proved to be effective. To reduce information loss during feature space projection, this study proposes a novel oversampling algorithm, named minority oversampling in kernel adaptive subspaces (MOKAS), which exploits the invariant feature extraction capability of a kernel version of the adaptive subspace self-organizing maps. The synthetic instances are generated from well-trained subspaces and then their pre-images are reconstructed in the input space. Additionally, these instances characterize nonlinear structures present in the minority class data distribution and help the learning algorithms to counterbalance the skewed class distribution in a desirable manner. Experimental results on both real and synthetic data show that the proposed MOKAS is capable of modeling complex data distribution and outperforms a set of state-of-the-art oversampling algorithms. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","adaptive subspace self-organizing maps; Class imbalance; kernel; minority oversampling","IEEE Computer Society"

Record linkage can be viewed as a classification problem where the aim is to decide whether a pair of records is a match (i.e. two records refer to the same real-world entity) or a non-match (two records refer to two different entities). Various classification techniques—including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised and active learning based—have been employed for record linkage. If ground truth data in the form of known true matches and non-matches are available, the quality of classified links can be evaluated. Due to the generally high class imbalance in record linkage problems, standard accuracy or misclassification rate are not meaningful for assessing the quality of a set of linked records. Instead, precision and recall, as commonly used in information retrieval and machine learning, are used. These are often combined into the popular F-measure, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. We show that the F-measure can also be expressed as a weighted sum of precision and recall, with weights which depend on the linkage method being used. This reformulation reveals that the F-measure has a major conceptual weakness: the relative importance assigned to precision and recall should be an aspect of the problem and the researcher or user, but not of the particular linkage method being used. We suggest alternative measures which do not suffer from this fundamental flaw. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Class imbalance; Classification; Data linkage; Entity resolution; Precision; Recall","Springer New York LLC"

Classically based on the visual evaluation of FIGO criteria, FHR characterization remains a challenging task that continuously receives intensive research efforts. Intrapartum FHR analysis is further complicated by the two different stages of labor (dilation and active pushing). Research works aimed at devising automated acidosis prediction procedures are either based on designing new advanced signal processing analyses or on efficiently combining a large number of features proposed in the literature. Such multi-feature procedures either rely on a prior feature selection step or end up with decision rules involving long lists of features. This many-feature outcome rule does not permit to easily interpret the decision and is hence not well suited for clinical practice. Machine-learning-based decision-rule assessment is often impaired by the use of different, proprietary and small databases, preventing meaningful comparisons of results reported in the literature. Here, sparse learning is promoted as a way to perform jointly feature selection and acidosis prediction, hence producing an optimal decision rule based on as few features as possible. Making use of a set of 20 features (gathering 'FIGO-like' features, classical spectral features and recently proposed scale-free features), applied to two large-size (respectively ≃1800 and ≃500 subjects), well-documented databases, collected independently in French and Czech hospitals, the benefits of sparse learning are quantified in terms of: (i) accounting for class imbalance (few acidotic subjects), (ii) producing simple and interpretable decision rules, (iii) evidences for differences between the temporal dynamics of active pushing and dilation stages, and (iv) of validity/generalizability of decision rules learned on one database and applied to the other one. © 2018 IOP Publishing Ltd.","acidosis prediction; intrapartum fetal heart rate; labor stages; learning generalization; scale-free; sparse learning","Institute of Physics Publishing"

DeepNAT is an end-to-end learning-based approach to brain segmentation that jointly learns an abstract feature representation and a multi-class classification. We propose a 3D patch-based approach, where we do not only predict the center voxel of the patch but also neighbors, which is formulated as multi-task learning. To address a class imbalance problem, we arrange two networks hierarchically, where the first one separates foreground from background, and the second one identifies 25 brain structures on the foreground. Since patches lack spatial context, we augment them with coordinates. To this end, we introduce a novel intrinsic parameterization of the brain volume, formed by eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator. As network architecture, we use three convolutional layers with pooling, batch normalization, and non-linearities, followed by fully connected layers with dropout. The final segmentation is inferred from the probabilistic output of the network with a 3D fully connected conditional random field, which ensures label agreement between close voxels. The roughly 2.7 million parameters in the network are learned with stochastic gradient descent. Our results show that DeepNAT compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods. Finally, the purely learning-based method may have a high potential for the adaptation to young, old, or diseased brains by fine-tuning the pre-trained network with a small training sample on the target application, where the availability of larger datasets with manual annotations may boost the overall segmentation accuracy in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Brain segmentation; Conditional random field; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Multi-task learning","Academic Press Inc."

The empirical tests were designed to compare the proposed model with MCQP and a selection of classifiers on 26 imbalanced datasets from the UCI repositories. The results indicate that the CS-MCQP model not only performs better than the optimization-based models (MCQP and SVM), but also outperforms the selected classifiers, ensemble, preprocessing techniques and hybrid methods on imbalanced datasets in terms of AUC and GeoMean measures. To validate the results statistically, Student's t test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were conducted and show that the superiority of CS-MCQP is statistically significant with significance level 0.05. In addition, we analyze the effect of noisy, small disjunct and overlapping data properties on the proposed model and conclude that the CS-MCQP model achieves better performance on imbalanced data with overlapping feature than noisy and small disjunct data. © Operational Research Society 2017.","Class imbalance problem; cost-sensitive classification; multi-criteria quadratic programming; multiple criteria decision making","Palgrave Macmillan Ltd."

An ad hoc approach in this regard can result in unexpectedly high misclassification rates, which may prove very costly in terms of people’s health and lives. In this paper, we illustrate a methodology to evaluate and compare multiple classification algorithms on multiple medical datasets.

Innovation: Modelling rare species’ distributions is a pressing challenge for conservation and applied research. Often, a large number of surveys are required before enough detections occur to model distributions of rare species accurately, resulting in a data set with a high proportion of non-detections (i.e. class imbalance). Citizen science data can provide a cost-effective source of surveys but likely suffer from class imbalance. Citizen science data also suffer from spatial bias, likely from preferential sampling. To correct for class imbalance and spatial bias, we used spatial filtering to under-sample the majority class (non-detection) while maintaining all of the limited information from the minority class (detection). We investigated the use of spatial under-sampling with randomForest models and compared it to common approaches used for imbalanced data, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE), weighted random forest and balanced random forest models. Model accuracy was assessed using kappa, Brier score and AUC. We demonstrate the method by evaluating habitat associations and seasonal distribution patterns using citizen science data for a rare species, the tricoloured blackbird (Agelaius tricolor). Main Conclusions: Spatial under-sampling increased the accuracy of each model and outperformed the approach typically used to direct under-sampling in the SMOTE algorithm. Our approach is the first to characterize winter distribution and movement of tricoloured blackbirds. Our results show that tricoloured blackbirds are positively associated with grassland, pasture and wetland habitats, and negatively associated with high elevations or evergreen forests during both winter and breeding seasons. The seasonal differences in distribution indicate that individuals move to the coast during the winter, as suggested by historical accounts. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","citizen science; class imbalance; random forest; spatial bias; species distribution model; tricoloured blackbird","Blackwell Publishing Ltd"

A wide range of CBIR applications consider classification techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), etc. to understand the query image content to retrieve relevant output. However, in multi-class search environments, the retrieval results are far from optimal due to overlapping semantics amongst subjects of various classes. The classification through multiple classifiers generate better results, but as the number of negative examples increases due to highly correlated semantic classes, classification bias occurs towards the negative class, hence, the combination of the classifiers become even more unstable particularly in one-against-all classification scenarios. In order to resolve this issue, a genetic algorithm (GA) based classifier comity learning (GCCL) method is presented in this paper to generate stable classifiers by combining ANN with SVMs through asymmetric and symmetric bagging. The proposed approach resolves the classification disagreement amongst different classifiers and also resolves the class imbalance problem in CBIR. Once the stable classifiers are generated, the query image is presented to the trained model to understand the underlying semantic content of the query image for association with the precise semantic class. Afterwards, the feature similarity is computed within the obtained class to generate the semantic response of the system. The experiments reveal that the proposed method outperforms various state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves the image retrieval performance. © 2018 by the authors.","Asymmetric bagging; CBIR; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Semantic association; SVM","MDPI AG"

There has been research in machine-learning that aims to predict landslides based on the statistical analysis of historical landslide events and its triggering factors. However, prediction of landslides suffers from a class-imbalance problem as landslides and land-movement are very rare events. In this paper, we apply state-of-the-art techniques to correct the class imbalance in landslide datasets. More specifically, to overcome the class-imbalance problem, we use different synthetic and oversampling techniques to a real-world landslide data collected from the Chandigarh - Manali highway. Also, we apply several machine-learning algorithms to the landslide data set for predicting landslides and evaluating our algorithms. Different algorithms have been assessed using techniques like the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and sensitivity index (d'). Results suggested that random forest algorithm performed better compared to other classification techniques like neural networks, logistic regression, support vector machines, and decision trees. Furthermore, among class-imbalance methods, the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique with iterative partitioning filter (SMOTE-IPF) performed better than other techniques.

A dataset is imbalanced when one class (the majority class) has significantly more samples than the other class (the minority class). Such datasets cause typical machine learning algorithms to perform poorly on the classification task. To overcome this issue, this paper proposes a new approach Neighbors' Progressive Competition (NPC) for classification of imbalanced datasets. Whilst the proposed algorithm is inspired by weighted k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) algorithms, it has major differences from them. Unlike k-NN, NPC does not limit its decision criteria to a preset number of nearest neighbors. In contrast, NPC considers progressively more neighbors of the query sample in its decision making until the sum of grades for one class is much higher than the other classes. Furthermore, NPC uses a novel method for grading the training samples to compensate for the imbalance issue. The grades are calculated using both local and global information. In brief, the contribution of this paper is an entirely new classifier for handling the imbalance issue effectively without any manually-set parameters or any need for expert knowledge. Experimental results compare the proposed approach with five representative algorithms applied to fifteen imbalanced datasets and illustrate this algorithm's effectiveness. © 2017 IEEE.","Imbalanced data; Nearest neighbors rule; Pattern classification","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

SIDER is one of the most reliable and frequently used datasets for identification of key features as well as building machine learning models for side effects prediction. The inherently unbalanced nature of this data presents with a difficult multi-label multi-class problem towards prediction of drug side effects. We highlight the intrinsic issue with SIDER data and methodological flaws in relying on performance measures such as AUC while attempting to predict side effects.We argue for the use of metrics that are robust to class imbalance for evaluation of classifiers. Importantly, we present a ‘hierarchical anatomical classification schema’ which aggregates side effects into organs, sub-systems, and systems. With the help of a weighted performance measure, using 5-fold cross-validation we show that this strategy facilitates biologically meaningful side effects prediction at different levels of anatomical hierarchy. By implementing various machine learning classifiers we show that Random Forest model yields best classification accuracy at each level of coarse-graining. The manually curated, hierarchical schema for side effects can also serve as the basis of future studies towards prediction of adverse reactions and identification of key features linked to specific organ systems. Our study provides a strategy for hierarchical classification of side effects rooted in the anatomy and can pave the way for calibrated expert systems for multi-level prediction of side effects. © 2018 Wadhwa et al.

Usually occurring on the skin, early detection and diagnosis is strongly related to survival rates. Melanoma recognition is a challenging task that nowadays is performed by well trained dermatologists who may produce varying diagnosis due to the task complexity. This motivates the development of automated diagnosis tools, in spite of the inherent difficulties (intra-class variation, visual similarity between melanoma and non-melanoma lesions, among others). In the present work, we propose a system combining image analysis and machine learning to detect melanoma presence and severity. The severity is assessed in terms of melanoma thickness, which is measured by the Breslow index. Previous works mainly focus on the binary problem of detecting the presence of the melanoma. However, the system proposed in this paper goes a step further by also considering the stage of the lesion in the classification task. To do so, we extract 100 features that consider the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the benign and malignant lesions. The problem is tackled as a five-class classification problem, where the first class represents benign lesions, and the remaining four classes represent the different stages of the melanoma (via the Breslow index). Based on the problem definition, we identify the learning setting as a partial order problem, in which the patterns belonging to the different melanoma stages present an order relationship, but where there is no order arrangement with respect to the benign lesions. Under this assumption about the class topology, we design several proposals to exploit this structure and improve data preprocessing. In this sense, we experimentally demonstrate that those proposals exploiting the partial order assumption achieve better performance than 12 baseline nominal and ordinal classifiers (including a deep learning model) which do not consider this partial order. To deal with class imbalance, we additionally propose specific over-sampling techniques that consider the structure of the problem for the creation of synthetic patterns.

Conventional feature selection methods usually ignore the class imbalance problem, thus the selected features will be biased towards the majority class. Considering that F-measure is a more reasonable performance measure than accuracy for imbalanced data, this paper presents an effective feature selection algorithm that explores the class imbalance issue by optimizing F-measures. Since F-measure optimization can be decomposed into a series of cost-sensitive classification problems, we investigate the costsensitive feature selection by generating and assigning different costs to each class with rigorous theory guidance. After solving a series of cost-sensitive feature selection problems, features corresponding to the best F-measure will be selected. In this way, the selected features will fully represent the properties of all classes. Experimental results on popular benchmarks and challenging real-world data sets demonstrate the significance of cost-sensitive feature selection for the imbalanced data setting and validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 IEEE.","Cost-sensitive; F-measure optimization; Feature selection; Imbalanced data","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Numerous machine learning approaches have proven effective in SDP. However, the unbalanced class distribution in SDP datasets could be a problem for some conventional learning methods. In addition, class overlap increases the difficulty for the predictors to learn the defective class accurately. In this study, we propose a new SDP model which combines class overlap reduction and ensemble imbalance learning to improve defect prediction. First, the neighbor cleaning method is applied to remove the overlapping non-defective samples. The whole dataset is then randomly under-sampled several times to generate balanced subsets so that multiple classifiers can be trained on these data. Finally, these individual classifiers are assembled with the AdaBoost mechanism to build the final prediction model. In the experiments, we investigated nine highly unbalanced datasets selected from a public software repository and confirmed that the high rate of overlap between classes existed in SDP data. We assessed the performance of our proposed model by comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods including conventional SDP models, imbalance learning and data cleaning methods. Test results and statistical analysis show that the proposed model provides more reasonable defect prediction results and performs best in terms of G-mean and AUC among all tested models. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Class imbalance; Class overlap; Machine learning; Software defect prediction","Springer New York LLC"

However, the classification performance of ML techniques is severely degraded due to the high dimensionality and redundancy of flow statistical features, the imbalance in the number of traffic flows and concept drift of Internet traffic. With the aim of comprehensively solving these problems, this paper proposes a new feature optimization approach based on deep learning and Feature Selection (FS) techniques to provide the optimal and robust features for traffic classification. Firstly, symmetric uncertainty is exploited to remove the irrelevant features in network traffic data sets, then a feature generation model based on deep learning is applied to these relevant features for dimensionality reduction and feature generation, finally Weighted Symmetric Uncertainty (WSU) is exploited to select the optimal features by removing the redundant ones. Based on real traffic traces, experimental results show that the proposed approach can not only efficiently reduce the dimension of feature space, but also overcome the negative impacts of multi-class imbalance and concept drift problems on ML techniques.

Those methods have important practical limitations when they have to be applied to a real prediction task. First, there is the challenge of dealing with a scarce number of positive (well-known) pre-miRNA examples. Secondly, it is very difficult to build a good set of negative examples for representing the full spectrum of non-miRNA sequences. Thirdly, in any genome, there is a huge class imbalance (1: 10 000) that is well-known for particularly affecting supervised classifiers. Results To enable efficient and speedy genome-wide predictions of novel miRNAs, we present miRNAss, which is a novel method based on semi-supervised learning. It takes advantage of the information provided by the unlabeled stem-loops, thereby improving the prediction rates, even when the number of labeled examples is low and not representative of the classes. An automatic method for searching negative examples to initialize the algorithm is also proposed so as to spare the user this difficult task. MiRNAss obtained better prediction rates and shorter execution times than state-of-the-art supervised methods. It was validated with genome-wide data from three model species, with more than one million of hairpin sequences each, thereby demonstrating its applicability to a real prediction task.

Aging-Related Bugs are hard to discover during software testing and also challenging to replicate. Automatic identification and prediction of aging related fault-prone files and classes in an object oriented system can help the software quality assurance team to optimize their testing efforts. In this paper, we present a study on the application of static source code metrics and machine learning techniques to predict aging related bugs. We conduct a series of experiments on publicly available dataset from two large open-source software systems: Linux and MySQL. Class imbalance and high dimensionality are the two main technical challenges in building effective predictors for aging related bugs. We investigate the application of five different feature selection techniques (OneR, Information Gain, Gain Ratio, RELEIF and Symmetric Uncertainty) for dimensionality reduction and five different strategies (Random Under-sampling, Random Oversampling, SMOTE, SMOTEBoost and RUSBoost) to counter the effect of class imbalance in our proposed machine learning based solution approach. Experimental results reveal that the random under-sampling approach performs best followed by RUSBoost in-terms of the mean AUC metric. Statistical significance test demonstrates that there is a significant difference between the performance of the various feature selection techniques. Experimental results shows that Gain Ratio and RELEIF performs best in comparison to other strategies to address the class imbalance problem. We infer from the statistical significance test that there is no difference between the performances of the five different learning algorithms. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.","Aging Related Bugs; Empirical software engineering; Feature selection techniques; Imbalance learning; Machine learning; Predictive modeling; Software maintenance; Source code metrics","Association for Computing Machinery"

It incorporates the features of complex business processing and sophisticated in-memory processing techniques for speed and throughput. These systems are distributed in nature, and they use a large number of processing nodes incorporating fault tolerance mechanisms. Complex systems also have a large effective number of strongly interdependent variables. Hence detecting faults and failures in stock market systems is a complex and cumbersome task. The study explores machine learning techniques to detect anomalous behavior to provide warnings before a system results in a fault or failure state. The study extensively utilizes a supervised learning approach with machine learning algorithms such as C4.5, Naïve Bayes, and ensemble techniques; bagging and Random Forest. The system statistics captured from log files are preprocessed and transformed to eliminate system environment dependencies. For each of the three components the initial feature selection is carried out manually using domain knowledge and expertise. Initial feature selection based on domain expertise was required as the number of features per component is large and does not closely relate to the system state. Feature selection methods (Info Gain algorithm with Ranker search) have been successfully employed to filter out unrelated attributes and to reduce computational complexity. A comparative evaluation is performed under each component status prediction. This study also utilizes oversampling techniques to overcome limitations caused by the class imbalance phenomena. A range of evaluators are used to analyze the results and effectiveness of the models. The highest accuracy and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) values are achieved when C4.5 decision tree is applied to the oversampled feature set and when the Random Forest algorithm is applied to the oversampled feature set.

An intrusion detection system based on information gain and random forest classifier is proposed. In order to solve the imbalance between classes, a small number of over-sampling algorithms is applied to the training data set. A feature selection method based on information gain is proposed, and it is used to construct the feature subtraction subsets of the data set. Firstly, the intrusion model is established from the training set by using the random forest algorithm, and the misuse detection model is constructed, and the known attacks are detected by matching the characteristics of the network connection. Then, by using the feature selection method of information gain, the network connection data of the uncertain attack is clustered according to the characteristic of the feature, and the detection of unknown attack is realized by clustering with the forest. The NSL-KDD intrusion detection data set used in the experiment is an enhanced version of the KDDCUP'99 data set. Due to the inherent characteristics of intrusion detection, there is a great imbalance between NSL-KDD data set.

It operates on raw domains and is amenable to immediate applications. LSTM is however prone to multiclass imbalance problem, which becomes even more significant in DGA malware detection. This is due the fact that many DGA classes have a very little support in the training dataset.

In this case, a machine learning technique will yield a good prediction accuracy from training data class with a large number of instances, but give a poor accuracy in classes with the small number of instances. In this research, we propose an approach for optimizing K-Means clustering in handling class imbalance problem. The approach uses the perceptron feed-forward neural network to determine coordinates of the centroid of a cluster in K-Means clustering processes. Data used in this research are datasets from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. From the experimental results obtained, the proposed approach could optimize the result of K-Means clustering in terms of minimizing class imbalance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Institute of Physics Publishing"

AFPs are supposed to be evolved from different types of protein families to perform the unique function of antifreeze activity and turn out to be the classical example of convergent evolution. The common sequence similarity search methods have failed to predict putative AFPs due to poor sequence and structural similarity that exists among the different sub-types of AFP. The machine learning techniques are the viable alternative approaches to predict putative AFPs. In this paper, we have discussed about the criteria (like apposite feature selection, balanced data sets and complete learning) that are needed to be taken into account for successful application of machine learning methods and implemented these criteria by using a clustering procedure in order to achieve the true performance of the learning algorithms. Diversified and representative training and testing data sets are very crucial for perfect learning as well as true testing of machine learning based prediction methods for two reasons: first is that a training dataset that lacks definable subset of input patterns makes prediction of patterns belonging to this subset either difficult or unfeasible (thus resulting in incomplete learning) and secondly a testing data set that lacks definable subset of input patterns does not tell about whether this subset of patterns can be correctly predicted by the classifier or not (thus resulting in incomplete testing). Moreover, balanced training and testing data sets are equally important for achieving the true (robust) performance of classifiers because a well-balanced training set eliminates bias of the classifier toward particular class/sub-class due to over-representation or under-representation of input patterns belonging to those classes/sub-classes. We have used K-means clustering algorithm for creating the diversified and balanced training as well as testing data sets, to overcome the shortcoming of random splitting, which cannot guarantee representative training and testing sets. The current clustering based optimal splitting criteria proved to be better than random splitting for creating training and testing set in terms of superior generalization and robust evaluation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Antifreeze proteins; Imbalance data set; Incomplete learning; K-means clustering; Physicochemical-n-grams; Representative training set","Elsevier B.V."

Predictive analytics is an AI stream used to predict future events based on historical learnings and is used in diverse fields like predicting online frauds, oil slicks, intrusion attacks, credit defaults, prognosis of disease cells etc. Unfortunately, in most of these cases, traditional learning models fail to generate required results due to imbalanced nature of data. Here imbalance denotes small number of instances belonging to the class under prediction like fraud instances in the total online transactions. The prediction in imbalanced classification gets further limited due to factors like small disjuncts which get accentuated during the partitioning of data when learning at scale. Synthetic generation of minority class data (SMOTE [1]) is one pioneering approach by Chawla [2] to offset said limitations and generate more balanced datasets. Although there exists a standard implementation of SMOTE in python, it is unavailable for distributed computing environments for large datasets. Bringing SMOTE to distributed environment under spark is the key motivation for our research. In this paper we present our algorithm, observations and results for synthetic generation of minority class data under spark using Locality Sensitivity Hashing[LSH].

It consists of physical perturbation of chip components to introduce faults in the code execution. A fault may be induced using a laser beam to impact opcodes and operands of instructions. This could lead to a mutation of the application code in such a way that it becomes hostile. Any successful attack may reveal a secret information stored in the card or grant an undesired authorisation. We propose a methodology to recognise, during the development step, the sensitive patterns to the fault attack in the Java Card applications. It is based on the concepts from text categorisation and machine learning. In fact, in this method, we represented the patterns using opcodes n-grams as features, and we evaluated different machine learning classifiers. The results show that the classifiers performed poorly when classifying dangerous sensitive patterns, due to the imbalance of our data-set. The number of dangerous sensitive patterns is much lower than the number of not dangerous patterns. We used resampling techniques to balance the class distribution in our data-set. The experimental results indicated that the resampling techniques improved the accuracy of the classifiers. In addition, our proposed method reduces the execution time of sensitive patterns classification in comparison to the SmartCM tool.

These problems are especially pressing in operational contexts where the total number of data points is extremely large and the cost of obtaining labels is very high. In the face of these issues, accurate estimation of the performance of a detection or classification system is crucial to inform decisions based on the observations. This paper presents a framework for estimating performance of a binary classifier in such a context. We focus on the scenario where each set of measurements has been reduced to a score, and the operator only investigates data when the score exceeds a threshold. The operator is blind to the number of missed detections, so performance estimation targets two quantities: recall and the derivative of precision with respect to recall. Measuring with respect to error in these two metrics, simulations in this context demonstrate that labeling outliers not only outperforms random labeling, but often matches performance of an adaptive method that attempts to choose the optimal data for labeling. Application to real anomaly detection data confirms the utility of the approach, and suggests direction for future work. © 2018 B.A. Miller, J. Vila, M. Kirn & J.R.

The existing weighting strategies assign the distribution-independent weight matrices for WELMs, i.e., the weights do not consider the probabilistic information of samples. This causes that WELM strengthens the affect of outliers to some extent. In this paper, a naive Bayesian based WELM (NBWELM) is proposed, in which the weight is determined with the flexible naive Bayesian (FNB) classifier. Through calculating the posterior probability of sample, NBWELM cannot only handle the outliers effectively but also consider two different weighting information i.e., the training error in weighted regularized ELM (WRELM) and class distribution in Zong et al.’s WELM (ZWELM), synchronously. The experimental results on 45 KEEL and UCI datasets show that our proposed NBWELM can further improve the generalization capability of WELM and thus obtain a higher classification accuracy than WRELM and ZWELM.

It is quite evident from the datasets like malaria, dengue, etc., where there is always a possibility of having more negative patients (non-occur-rence of the disease) compared to patients suffering from disease (positive cases). Developing a model based decision support system with such unbalanced datasets is a cause of concern and it is indeed necessary to have a model predicting the disease quite accurately. Classification of imbalanced malaria disease data become a crucial task in medical application domain because most of the conventional machine learning algorithms are showing very poor performance to classify whether a patient is affected by malaria disease or not. In imbalanced data, majority (unaffected) class samples are dominates the minority (affected) class samples leading to class imbalance. To overcome the nature of class imbalance problem, balancing the data samples is the best solution which produces the better accuracy in classification of minority samples. The aim of this research is to propose a comparative study on classifying the imbalanced malaria disease data using Naive Bayesian classifier in different environments like weka and using an R-language. We present here, clinical descriptive study on 165 patients of different age group people collected at medical wards of Narasaraopet from 2014-17. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) technique has been used to balance the class distribution and then we performed a comparative study on the dataset using Naïve Bayesian algorithm in various platforms. Out of balanced class distribution data, 70% data was given to train the Naive Bayesian algorithm and the rest of the data was used for testing the model for both weka and R programming environments. Experimental results have indicated that, classification of malaria disease data in weka environment has highest accuracy of 88.5% than the Naive Bayesian algorithm accuracy of 87.5% using R programming language. The impact of vector borne disease is very high in medical applications. Prediction of disease like malaria is an hour of the need and this is possible only with a suitable model for a given dataset. Hence, we have developed a model with Naive Bayesian algorithm is used for current research. © 2018 Authors.","Imbalanced Data; Malaria; Naïve Bayesian; R; Weka","Science Publishing Corporation Inc"

In this regard, Machine Learning (ML) has been successfully applied to solve classification problems for SFP. However, SFP has many challenges that are created due to redundant and irrelevant features, class imbalance problem and the presence of noise in software defect datasets. Yet, neither of ML techniques alone handles those challenges and those may deteriorate the performance depending on the predictor’s sensitiveness to data corruptions. In the literature, it is widely claimed that building ensemble classifiers from preprocessed datasets and combining their predictions is an interesting method of overcoming the individual problems produced by each classifier. This statement is usually not supported by thorough empirical studies considering problems in combined implementation with resolving different types of challenges in defect datasets and, therefore, it must be carefully studied. Thus, the objective of this paper is to conduct large scale comprehensive experiments to study the effect of resolving those challenges in SFP in three stages in order to improve the practice and performance of SFP. In addition to that, the paper presents a thorough and statistically sound comparison of these techniques in each stage. Accordingly, a new three-stage based ensemble learning framework that efficiently handles those challenges in a combined form is proposed. The experimental results confirm that the proposed framework has exhibited the robustness of combined techniques in each stage. Particularly high performance results have achieved using combined ELA on selected features of balanced data after removing noise instances. Therefore, as shown in this study, ensemble techniques used for SFP must be carefully examined and combined with techniques to resolve those challenges and obtain robust performance so as to accurately identify the fault prone software modules. © 2018, the Authors.","Data balancing; Ensemble learning algorithms; Feature selection; Noise filtering; Software fault prediction; Software testing","Atlantis Press"

This paper proposes a novel method for generating balanced data by the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). It does not depend on the probability distribution of the data. The discriminator and the generator constantly confront each other to make the generated new sample have a high degree of similarity with the original sample distribution.

For chemical property prediction tasks, the sample size of the training data is often small and/or a label imbalance problem occurs, where a few samples belong to a single class and the majority of samples belong to the other classes. This can lead to uncertainty related to the learned parameters of the machine learning model. To address this uncertainty, we propose BayesGrad, utilizing the Bayesian predictive distribution, to define the importance of each node in an input graph, which is computed efficiently using the dropout technique. We demonstrate that BayesGrad successfully visualizes the substructures responsible for the label prediction in the artificial experiment, even when the sample size is small. Furthermore, we use a real dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the visualization.

Materials and Methods: Literature works considered source code metrics for object-oriented software systems in order to measure the complexity of a software. In order to predict the need of refactoring, the proposed system computes twenty-five different source code metrics at the method level and utilize them as features in a machine learning framework. An open source dataset consisting of five different software systems is being considered for conducting a series of experiments in order to assess the performance of proposed approach. LSSVM with SMOTE data imbalance technique are being utilized in order to overcome the class imbalance problem. Conclusion: Analysis of the results reveals that LS-SVM with RBF kernel using SMOTE results in the best performance. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Kernels; LSSVM; Refactoring; Smote; Source code metrics","Springer Verlag"

Usually, the class imbalance problem occurs when one class of data severely outnumbers the other classes of data, thus leads to skewed class boundaries. In the case of online class imbalance problem, the degree of class imbalance changes over time and the present state of imbalance is not known a prior to the learner. To address such problem, in this paper, we present an Oversampling based Online Large Scale Support Vector Machine (OOLASVM) algorithm which is a hybrid of active sample selection and over sampling of Support Vectors and thereby both oversampling and under sampling coexists while learning the new boundary.

In order to mitigate the NLOS ranging error caused by various obstacles in UWB ranging process, some scholars have applied machine learning methods such as support vector machine and support vector data description to the identification NLOS signals for mitigation NLOS error in recent years. Therefore, the identification of NLOS signals is of great significance in UWB positioning. The traditional machine learning method is based on the assumption that the number of samples of the line-of-sight (LOS) and NLOS signals are balanced. However, in reality, the number of LOS signals in UWB positioning is much larger than the NLOS signals. So the samples are characterized by class-imbalance. In response to this fact, we applied a fast imbalanced binary classification method based on moments (MIBC) to identify NLOS signals. The method uses the mean and covariance of the two first moments of the LOS signal samples to represent its probability distribution and then uses the probability distribution and all a small amount of NLOS signal samples to establish a model. This method does not depend on the number of LOS signals and is suitable for dealing with the problem of classification of the imbalance between the number of LOS and NLOS signals. Numerical simulations also verify that the method has better performance than LS-SVM and SVDD. © 2018 Bo Song et al.",,"Hindawi Limited"

Classifiers such as support vector machines (SVM), combined with bag of words or ngram feature representation, have traditionally dominated in text classification for decades. With the recent emergence of deep learning and word embeddings, an increasing number of researchers have started to focus on deep neural networks. In this paper, our aim is to explore cutting-edge techniques in automated abusive content detection. We use two deep learning approaches: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We apply these to 9 public datasets derived from various social media websites. Firstly, we show that word embeddings pre-trained on the same data source as the subsequent classification task improves the prediction accuracy of deep learning models. Secondly, we investigate the impact of different levels of training set imbalances on classifier types. In comparison to the traditional SVM classifier, we identify that although deep learning models can outperform the classification results of the traditional SVM classifier when the associated training dataset is seriously imbalanced, the performance of the SVM classifier can be dramatically improved through the use of oversampling, surpassing the deep learning models.

Taking into account the enormous growth of biomedical literature publicly available over Internet, one relevant task for the biomedical community is the automatic classification of relevant documents for further research. Objective: Focusing on this topic, the objective of this work is two-fold: to evaluate alternative strategies also proposing a novel approach denoted as LITl (Limited Iterative Tomek links) for alleviating the class imbalance problem, and to analyse the true impact of unbalanced data for the accurate triage of biomedical documents. Method: Different strategies are applied and evaluated over a standard corpus of Medline documents where each entry is represented by a set of MeSH terms. Results: Results obtained from experimentation demonstrate the real effect of class imbalance over popular classifiers such as kNN, Naive Bayes, SVM and C4.5, and show how their performance can be improved when using appropriate balancing strategies. Conclusion: The classifier that least suffers from an imbalanced scenario comprising Medline documents is Naive Bayes. Moreover, we demonstrated that the performance of a given balancing strategy largely depends on the selected classifier. In this sense, those classifiers that are best suited to work with our LITl approach are kNN and C4.5. © 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.","Document triage; LITL algorithm; Medline manuscripts; MeSH terms; Naive bayes; Unbalanced data","Bentham Science Publishers B.V."

Perceptions of pain and its consequent disabling effects are often heightened under the conditions of greater uncertainty and unpredictability associated with pain volatility. Objective: This study aimed to use data mining and machine learning methods to (1) define a new measure of pain volatility and (2) predict future pain volatility levels from users of the pain management app, Manage My Pain, based on demographic, clinical, and app use features. Methods: Pain volatility was defined as the mean of absolute changes between 2 consecutive self-reported pain severity scores within the observation periods. The k-means clustering algorithm was applied to users' pain volatility scores at the first and sixth month of app use to establish a threshold discriminating low from high volatility classes. Subsequently, we extracted 130 demographic, clinical, and app usage features from the first month of app use to predict these 2 volatility classes at the sixth month of app use. Prediction models were developed using 4 methods: (1) logistic regression with ridge estimators; (2) logistic regression with Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator; (3) Random Forests; and (4) Support Vector Machines. Overall prediction accuracy and accuracy for both classes were calculated to compare the performance of the prediction models. Training and testing were conducted using 5-fold cross validation. A class imbalance issue was addressed using a random subsampling of the training dataset. Users with at least five pain records in both the predictor and outcome periods (N=782 users) are included in the analysis. Results: k-means clustering algorithm was applied to pain volatility scores to establish a threshold of 1.6 to differentiate between low and high volatility classes. After validating the threshold using random subsamples, 2 classes were created: low volatility (n=611) and high volatility (n=171). In this class-imbalanced dataset, all 4 prediction models achieved 78.1% (611/782) to 79.0% (618/782) in overall accuracy. However, all models have a prediction accuracy of less than 18.7% (32/171) for the high volatility class. After addressing the class imbalance issue using random subsampling, results improved across all models for the high volatility class to greater than 59.6% (102/171). The prediction model based on Random Forests performs the best as it consistently achieves approximately 70% accuracy for both classes across 3 random subsamples. Conclusions: We propose a novel method for measuring pain volatility. Cluster analysis was applied to divide users into subsets of low and high volatility classes. These classes were then predicted at the sixth month of app use with an acceptable degree of accuracy using machine learning methods based on the features extracted from demographic, clinical, and app use information from the first month. © 2018 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Their underlying principle revolves around the recursive partitioning of the feature space into disjoint subsets, each of which should ideally contain only a single class. This is achieved by selecting features and conditions that allow for the most effective split of the tree structure. Traditionally, impurity metrics are used to measure the effectiveness of a split, as ideally in a given subset only instances from a single class should be present. In this paper, we discuss the underlying shortcoming of such an assumption and introduce the notion of local class imbalance. We show that traditional splitting criteria induce the emergence of increasing class imbalances as the tree structure grows. Therefore, even when dealing with initially balanced datasets, class imbalance will become a problem during decision tree induction. At the same time, we show that existing skew-insensitive split criteria return inferior performance when data is roughly balanced. To address this, we propose a simple, yet effective hybrid decision tree architecture that is capable of dynamically switching between standard and skew-insensitive splitting criterion during decision tree induction. Our experimental study depicts that local class imbalance is embedded in most standard classification problems and that the proposed hybrid approach is capable of alleviating its influence. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Class imbalance; Decision trees; Machine learning; Splitting criteria","Springer Verlag"

It is based on the use of Ito decomposition and Logistic Regression. Design/methodology/approach: The technology of machine learning is used to solve the task. The developed classification method is based on the application of multiclass Logistic Regression. In order to reduce the probability of incorrect alloy identification, expansion of the input characteristics based on the Ito decomposition of the second order has been made. On the one hand, it increased the dimension of the input features space, and as a result, it increased the time for training procedure, but on the other, it increased the solution accuracy of the alloys selection task. The accuracy evaluation of the method was carried out using different criteria. In particular, the method accuracy was estimated based on the ratio of correctly classified titanium alloys samples to the test sample dimension. This measure was used to assess the classification accuracy in the training and test modes. For a more detailed analysis of the classification method results, two additional measures were further used: Precision and Recall. Their calculation was based on the constructed confusion matrix. This made it possible to assess the ability of the developed method to find the instances of each individual alloy as a whole, as well as the ability to distinguish instances of one class from representatives on the other. The combination of these indicators allowed to evaluate the classification task accuracy in the conditions of the imbalance dataset for each class of the investigated material separately. Findings: The simulation results confirmed the effectiveness of the use of machine learning tools to solve this task. High indicators of the method’s accuracy based on the experimental results were established. In particular, the overall accuracy of the method is 96.875%, and the average values of Precision and Recall for all four classes are 94% and 98% respectively. Expansion of each vector’s features from the training dataset by using Ito decomposition increased the method accuracy by more than 33% compared to the basic Logistic Regression. Research limitations/implications: The Logistic Regression’s training procedure, as well as the increase of the space size of the investigated alloy’s input features by using Ito decomposition, imposes a number of limitations on the application of the method in tasks that depend on the duration of the work. Practical implications: The proposed machine learning approach for alloys selection allows reducing the time, material and human resources needed to investigate the titanium alloys properties. The developed method increases the accuracy of the selection alloys task compared to the four known methods, an average of 14.5%. It can be used to select materials with appropriate properties for the design of biocompatible medical products. Originality/value: A method and software product for the titanium alloys classification task using a supervised learning technique has been developed.

This situation hinders the applicability of conventional machine learning algorithms to most of the classification problems where class imbalance is prominent. Most existing methods addressing class imbalance either rely on sampling techniques or cost-sensitive learning methods; thus inheriting their shortcomings. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that is different from sampling or cost-sensitive learning based techniques, to address the class imbalance problem, where two samples are simultaneously considered to train the classifier. Further, we propose a mechanism to use a single base classifier, instead of an ensemble of classifiers, to obtain the output label of the test sample using majority voting method.

This work studies the performance degradation of classifiers with distinct learning biases in overlap and imbalanced contexts, focusing on the characteristics of the test domains (shape, dimensionality and imbalance ratio) and on to what extent our proposed overlapping measure (degOver) is aligned with the performance results observed. Our results show that MLP and CART classifiers are the most robust to high levels of class overlap, even for complex domains, and that KNN and linear SVM are the most aligned with degOver.

To improve the environment, huge amounts of data are gathered, manipulated, analyzed, and utilized, and these data might include noise, uncertainty, or unexpected mistreatment of the data. In some datasets, the class imbalance problem skews the learning performance of the classification algorithms. In this paper, we propose a case-based reasoning method that combines the use of crowd knowledge from open source data and collective knowledge. This method mitigates the class imbalance issues resulting from datasets, which diagnose wellness levels in patients suffering from stress or depression. We investigate effective ways to mitigate class imbalance issues in which the datasets have a higher proportion of one class over another. The results of this proposed hybrid reasoning method, using a combination of crowd knowledge extracted from open source data (i.e., a Google search, or other publicly accessible source) and collective knowledge (i.e., case-based reasoning), were that it performs better than other traditional methods (e.g., SMO, BayesNet, IBk, Logistic, C4.5, and crowd reasoning).

Existing methods follow either a computer vision approach while failing to account for class imbalance, or explore machine learning solutions, which disregard the spatial and semantic relations that exist in the images. With that in mind, we propose an effective method that extracts and aggregates visual attention masks at different scales. We introduce a loss function to handle class imbalance both at class and at an instance level and further demonstrate that penalizing attention masks with high prediction variance accounts for the weak supervision of the attention mechanism.

Yet we face a major challenge: it is difficult to precisely map species across landscapes. Novel Earth observations could overcome this challenge for vegetation mapping. Airborne imaging spectrometers measure plant functional traits at high resolution, and these measurements can be used to identify tree species. In this paper, I describe a trait-based approach to species identification with imaging spectroscopy, the Center for Conservation Biology species identification (CCB-ID) method, which was developed as part of an ecological data science evaluation competition. Methods: These methods were developed using airborne imaging spectroscopy data from the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON). CCB-ID classified tree species using trait-based reflectance variation and decision tree-based machine learning models, approximating a morphological trait and dichotomous key method inspired by botanical classification. First, outliers were removed using a spectral variance threshold. The remaining samples were transformed using principal components analysis (PCA) and resampled to reduce common species biases. Gradient boosting and random forest classifiers were trained using the transformed and resampled feature data. Prediction probabilities were calibrated using sigmoid regression, and sample-scale predictions were averaged to the crown scale. Results: CCB-ID received a rank-1 accuracy score of 0.919, and a cross-entropy cost score of 0.447 on the competition test data. Accuracy and specificity scores were high for all species, but precision and recall scores varied for rare species. PCA transformation improved accuracy scores compared to models trained using reflectance data, but outlier removal and data resampling exacerbated class imbalance problems. Discussion: CCB-ID accurately classified tree species using NEON data, reporting the best scores among participants. However, it failed to overcome several species mapping challenges like precisely identifying rare species. Key takeaways include (1) selecting models using metrics beyond accuracy (e.g., recall) could improve rare species predictions, (2) within-genus trait variation may drive spectral separability, precluding efforts to distinguish between functionally convergent species, (3) outlier removal and data resampling can exacerbate class imbalance problems, and should be carefully implemented, (4) PCA transformation greatly improved model results, and (5) targeted feature selection could further improve species classification models. CCB-ID is open source, designed for use with NEON data, and available to support species mapping efforts. © Copyright 2018 Anderson et al.","Biogeography; Imaging spectroscopy; Modeling; Open source; Remote sensing; Species mapping","PeerJ Inc."

Skin cancers are the most common types of cancers, melanoma being the most deadly among them. RCM is an effective, non-invasive pre-screening tool for skin cancer diagnosis, with the required cellular resolution. However, images are complex, low-contrast, and highly variable, so that it requires months to years of expert-level training for clinicians to be able to make accurate assessments. In this paper we address classifying 4 key clinically important structural/textural patterns in RCM images. The occurrence and morphology of these patterns are used by clinicians for diagnosis of melanomas. The large size of RCM images, the large variance of pattern size, the large scale range over which patterns appear, the class imbalance in collected images, and the lack of fully-labelled images all make this a challenging problem to address, even with automated machine learning tools. We designed a novel nested U-net architecture to cope with these challenges, and a selective loss function to handle partial labeling. Trained and tested on 56 melanoma-suspicious, partially labelled, 12k × 12k pixel images, our network automatically annotated RCM images for these diagnostic patterns with high sensitivity and specificity, providing consistent labels for unlabelled sections of the test images. We believe that providing such annotation in a fast manner will aid clinicians in achieving diagnostic accuracy, and perhaps more important, dramatically facilitate clinical training, thus enabling much more rapid adoption of RCM into widespread clinical use process. In addition our adaptation of U-net architecture provides an intrinsically multiresolution deep network that may be useful in other challenging biomedical image analysis applications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Melanoma; Reflectance confocal microscopy; Segmentation","Springer Verlag"

ICU readmission is a critical problem that is associated with physiological variable selection, imbalanced data, noises and outliers. Previously proposed approaches, such as scoring system (APACHE II) or classical data mining techniques did not tackle these issues. In this paper, the ICU readmission information is represented by feature vectors including blood pressure, respiratory rate, arterial base excess, hematocrit, etc. Sequential forward selection (SFS) is applied to select the best predictors for ICU readmission prediction. A fuzzy membership calculation method is proposed, which uses fuzzy cosine algorithm and fuzzy distance function to modify the fuzzy membership values of each sample to deal with the readmission prediction problem with noises and outliers. Fuzzy weights are adopted based on the different distribution of majority class and minority class. The performance of FSVM technique is compared with other existing imbalance-learning methods, such as over sampling, under sampling, and Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) using 5-fold cross validation evaluation. The experimental results show that the proposed FSVM is a stable and competitive method for ICU readmission prediction on class imbalance dataset with outliers and noises. © 2018 Institute of Industrial Engineers (IIE).

For example, in the intensive care unit (ICU) existing automated alarm systems typically rely on simple thresholding that result in frequent false positives. Recurrent false positive alerts create distrust of alarm mechanisms that can be directly detrimental to patient health. To improve patient care in the ICU, we need alert systems that are both pervasive, and accurate so as to be informative and trusted by providers. Objective: We aimed to develop a machine learning-based classifier to detect abnormal waveform events using the use case of mechanical ventilation waveform analysis, and the detection of harmful forms of ventilation delivery to patients. We specifically focused on detecting injurious subtypes of patient-ventilator asynchrony (PVA). Methods: Using a dataset of breaths recorded from 35 different patients, we used machine learning to create computational models to automatically detect, and classify two types of injurious PVA, double trigger asynchrony (DTA), breath stacking asynchrony (BSA). We examined the use of synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to overcome class imbalance problems, varied methods for feature selection, and use of ensemble methods to optimize the performance of our model. Results: We created an ensemble classifier that is able to accurately detect DTA at a sensitivity/specificity of 0.960/0.975, BSA at sensitivity/specificity of 0.944/0.987, and non-PVA events at sensitivity/specificity of.967/.980. Conclusions: Our results suggest that it is possible to create a high-performing machine learning-based model for detecting PVA in mechanical ventilator waveform data in spite of both intra-patient, and inter-patient variability in waveform patterns, and the presence of clinical artifacts like cough and suction procedures. Our work highlights the importance of addressing class imbalance in clinical data sets, and the combined use of statistical methods and expert knowledge in feature selection. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG 2018.","artificial respiration; clinical decision support systems; intensive care units; machine learning; Patient ventilator asynchrony","Georg Thieme Verlag"

However, ELM also suffers from the imbalanced classification problem, which exists in many fields and degrades the performance of classifier significantly. In order to address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel parallel one-class ELM based on Bayesian approach for imbalanced classification problem, named P-ELM. In P-ELM, the training dataset is firstly divided into k (k is the number of classes) components according to the class attribution of the samples, and then the divided training datasets will be fed into the corresponding k Kernel-based one-class ELM classifiers. Estimation of the probability density based on the output function of Kernel-based one-class ELM classifier is constructed. Thus, the class attribution of the samples can be judged directly by comparing the values of the output function of each Kernel-based one-class ELM classifier of P-ELM based on the Bayesian approach. The detailed performance comparison and discussions of P-ELM are performed with several related class imbalance learning approaches on some selected benchmark datasets including both the binary classification and the multiclass classification problems, as well as a real world application, i.e., the blast furnace status diagnosis problem. The experimental results show that the proposed P-ELM can achieve better performance. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Bayesian approach; Blast furnace status diagnosis; Extreme learning machine; Imbalanced classification; One-class extreme learning machine","Springer Verlag"

This problem is particularly important, since it causes suboptimal classification performances, especially when the cost of misclassifying a minority-class example is substantial. Unlike the prior test sample sparse representation on balanced data sets, which cannot reflect the data distribution in real applications, we proposed a novel sparse representation learning algorithm called Balanced Sparse Representation Classifier (BSRC), considering the contribution from heavily under-represented of minority classes. Our solution first estimates the contribution of training sample in each class, and then identifies the nearest neighbors with the largest contributions. After that, the test data is expressed based on linear combination of all the nearest samples. Finally, the decision has been made according to sum of contribution for each class. Moreover, we also present the kernel extension of the proposed classifier to deal with complex data.

Forums are among information technologies utilized in a course to encourage students to communicate with lecturers more outside a traditional class. Free-styled textual posts in those communications express the problems that the students are facing as well as the interest and activeness of the students with respect to each topic of a course. Exploiting such textual data in a course forum for course-level student prediction is considered in our work. Due to hierarchical structures in course forum texts, we propose a method in this paper which combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and an adopted and adapted loss function for more correct recognitions of instances of the minority class which includes students with failure. A CNN model with data imbalance handling is a novel method appropriate for the course-level student prediction task. Indeed, through an empirical evaluation, our method has been confirmed to be an effective solution. Compared to other methods such as C4.5, Support Vector Machines, and Long-Short Term Memory networks, the proposed method can provide higher Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F-measure on average for early predictions of the students with either success or failure in two different real courses. Such better predictions can help both students and lecturers beware of students’ study and support them in time for ultimate success in a course. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.","Convolutional neural network; Data imbalance; Mean squared error; Mean squared false error; Student prediction","Springer Verlag"

ELM-AE with norm optimization is utilized to extract more effective information from raw data, thereby forming a hierarchical and compact feature representation. Afterwards, random projections of learned feature results view as inputs of the W-ELM. An adaptive weighting scheme is designed to reduce the misclassified rate of the minority class by assigning a larger weight to minority samples. The classification performance of the proposed method is evaluated on two biomedical datasets from the UCI repository.

In this scenario it is not possible to adopt human-driven solutions due to the huge number of involved operations. The only approach is therefore to adopt automatic solutions able to discern the legitimate transactions from the fraudulent ones. For this reason, today the development of techniques capable of carrying out this task efficiently represents a very active research field that involves a large number of researchers around the world. Unfortunately, this is not an easy task, since the definition of effective fraud detection approaches is made difficult by a series of well-known problems, the most important of them being the non-balanced class distribution of data that leads towards a significant reduction of the machine learning approaches performance. Such limitation is addressed by the approach proposed in this paper, which exploits three different metrics of similarity in order to define a three-dimensional space of evaluation. Its main objective is a better characterization of the financial transactions in terms of the two possible target classes (legitimate or fraudulent), facing the information asymmetry that gives rise to the problem previously exposed. A series of experiments conducted by using real-world data with different size and imbalance level, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach with regard to the state-of-the-art solutions.

Most of the different medical disease datasets such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease databases have homogeneous and heterogeneous features for disease prediction. An efficient feature extraction algorithm is necessary to improve the performance of the classification model in medical disease prediction. However, traditional feature selection algorithms are depend on the feature space and data size in large databases. Also, a parallel ensemble learning classifier is necessary to handle the multi-class problem in the traditional classification algorithms for disease prediction. As the size of the Alzheimer’s disease patterns and its categories are increasing, traditional data classification models are required to increase the memory and computational time for disease prediction due to inconsistent, class imbalance, and sparsity issues, which may affect the disease prediction rate and error rate. Therefore, an efficient PSO based parallel ensemble model for predicting the severity level of the heterogeneous feature types is designed and implemented with high true positivity and low error rate. In this paper, an optimized PSO high dimensional feature selection model is used to enhance the classification rate of the multi-class SVM model in the ensemble classifier.

We show that exploiting the symmetry and feature value imbalance of binary datasets, more efficient feature selection measures that can better distinguish the classes in multiclass binary datasets can be developed. Using these measures, we propose a greedy feature selection algorithm, CovSkew, for multiclass binary data.

It secondly designs novel metrics, which have strong correlation with defects, based on the analysis on code complexity or development process. Then it uses these metrics to measure these program modules. It finally uses a specific machine learning algorithm to construct software defect prediction models, which are trained on these datasets. Therefore software defect prediction can optimize the software testing resource allocation by identifying the potential defect modules in advance. However in real software development, a project, which needs defect prediction, maybe a new project or it maybe has less training data. A simple solution is directly using training data from other projects to construct the model. However application domain, development process, used programming language, developer experience of different projects may be not same. This will cause the distribution of corresponding datasets to be large and result in the poor performance of defect prediction. Therefore, how to effectively transfer the knowledge of the source project to build a defect prediction model for the target project has attracted the attention of researchers, and this problem is called cross-project defect prediction (CPDP).We conduct a comprehensive survey on this topic and classify existing methods into three categories: supervised learning based methods, unsupervised learning based methods, and semi-supervised learning based methods. In particular, the supervised learning based methods will use the modules of the source project to construct the model. These methods can be further classified into two categories: homogeneous cross-project defect learning and heterogeneous cross-project defect prediction based on whether the source project and the target project use the same metric set. For the former, researchers design novel methods by using metric value transformation, instance selection and weight setting, feature mapping and selection, ensemble learning, class imbalance learning. For the latter, the issue is more challenging and researchers design novel methods by using feature mapping and canonical correlation analysis. The unsupervised learning based methods will attempt to make a prediction on the modules of the target project immediately. The assumption of these methods is that the metric value of defective modules has the tendency to be higher than the metric value of non-defective modules. Researchers design novel methods by using cluster algorithms. The semi-supervised learning based methods will use the modules of the source project and some labeled programs in the target project together to construct the model. These methods try to improve the performance of CPDP by identifying some representative program modules in the target project and label them manually. Researchers design novel methods by using ensemble learning and TrAdaBoost. We summarize and comment the existing research work for each category in sequence. Then we analyze the commonly used performance metrics and benchmarks in empirical studies in CPDP for other researchers to better design empirical studies. Finally we conclude this paper and discuss some potentially future research work from four dimensions: dataset gathering, dataset preprocessing, CPDP model construction and evaluation, and CPDP model application. © 2018, Science Press.

Three-Dimensional Radar is one of the most prominent sensors that has shown a great capacity for detecting concealed SAEHs. This system produces high-resolution volumetric images where each voxel's intensity represents the radar signal return at a specific point in the three-dimensional space. It has the capability to enhance the signal response from a SAEH nested in camouflage materials and suppress the interference from the surroundings. Nevertheless, processing the radar data in the spatial domain has some limitations in differentiating SAEH from clutter objects. In this paper, we propose the use of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to analyze the voxel data and capture the spatial frequency characteristics of the radar signal from SAEHs. Through a machine learning approach, our proposed algorithm is able to identify the frequency signatures of SAEHs and to differentiate them from anomalies caused by the background or clutter. This approach yields a confidence value indicating the likelihood of a SAEH at a particular location. The detection ability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves generated using a dataset collected from a U.S. Army test site. © 2018 SPIE.","3-dimensional radar; Boosting; class imbalance; explosive hazard detection; Fourier transform; side-attack explosive; voxel","SPIE"

This is a challenging task as variability exists with respect to the objects, their environment and emplacement context, to name a few factors. A goal is the development of automatic or human-in-the-loop sensor technologies that leverage signal processing, data fusion and machine learning. Herein, we explore the detection of side attack explosive hazards (SAEHs) in three dimensional voxel space radar via different shallow and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Dimensionality reduction is performed by using multiple projected images versus the raw three dimensional voxel data, which leads to noteworthy savings in input size and associated network hyperparameters. Last, we explore the accuracy and interpretation of solutions learned via random versus intelligent network weight initialization. Experiments are provided on a U.S. Army data set collected over different times, weather conditions, target types and concealments. Preliminary results indicate that deep learning can perform as good as, if not better, than a skilled domain expert, even in light of limited training data with a class imbalance. © 2018 SPIE.","deep learning; Side attack explosive detection; voxel space radar","SPIE"

Ensemble-based methods are among the most widely used techniques for data stream classification. Their popularity is attributable to their good performance in comparison to strong single learners while being relatively easy to deploy in real-world applications. Ensemble algorithms are especially useful for data stream learning as they can be integrated with drift detection algorithms and incorporate dynamic updates, such as selective removal or addition of classifiers. We propose an ensemble based Deep CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) algorithm for streaming imbalanced data classification. The proposed model is designed to handle and classify high dimensional data. So the dimensionality is reduced with PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method. The redundant and irrelevant attributes are eliminated by the heuristic based feature selection algorithm. This is done to improve the accuracy of classifying the instances. The analysis includes the elimination of irrelevant and duplicate data so as to improve the accuracy to further extent. Learning will help to classify the instances more accurately and refine the boundaries of the classes.

Stacking ensemble is an efficient algorithm for normal balance data sets. However, stacking ensemble was seldom applied in imbalance data. In this paper, we proposed a novel RE-sample and Cost-Sensitive Stacked Generalization (RECSG) method based on 2-layer learning models. The first step is Level 0 model generalization including data preprocessing and base model training. The second step is Level 1 model generalization involving cost-sensitive classifier and logistic regression algorithm. In the learning phase, preprocessing techniques can be embedded in imbalance data learning methods. In the cost-sensitive algorithm, cost matrix is combined with both data characters and algorithms. In the RECSG method, ensemble algorithm is combined with imbalance data techniques. According to the experiment results obtained with 17 public imbalanced data sets, as indicated by various evaluation metrics (AUC, GeoMean, and AGeoMean), the proposed method showed the better classification performances than other ensemble and single algorithms.

Class imbalance is the most challenging issue encountered when performing classification, i.e. when the number of instances belonging to the class of interest (minor class) is much lower than that of other classes (major classes). The class imbalance problem has become more and more marked while applying machine learning algorithms to real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, text classification, fraud detection, etc. Standard classifiers may yield very good results regarding the majority classes. However, this kind of classifiers yields bad results regarding the minority classes since they assume a relatively balanced class distribution and equal misclassification costs. To overcome this problem, we propose, in this paper, a novel associative classification algorithm called Association Rule-based Classification for Imbalanced Datasets (ARCID). This algorithm aims to extract significant knowledge from imbalanced datasets by emphasizing on information extracted from minor classes without drastically impacting the predictive accuracy of the classifier. Experimentations, against five datasets obtained from the UCI repository, have been conducted with reference to four assessment measures. Results show that ARCID outperforms standard algorithms.

To address these problems, Cost-sensitive Collaborative Representation based Classification via Probability Estimation Addressing the Class Imbalance Problem method was proposed. The class label of test samples was predict by minimizing the misclassification losses which are obtained via computing the posterior probabilities.

Despite current advances in MRI, non-invasive diagnosis of paediatric brain tumours has yet to find its way into routine clinical practice. Radiomics, the high-throughput extraction and analysis of quantitative image features (e.g. texture), offers potential solutions for tumour characterization and decision support. In the search for diagnostic oncological markers, the primary aim of this work was to study the application of MRI texture analysis (TA) for the classification of paediatric brain tumours. A multicentre study was carried out, within a supervised classification framework, on clinical MR images, and a support vector machine (SVM) was trained with 3D textural attributes obtained from conventional MRI. To determine the cross-centre transferability of TA, an assessment of how SVM performs on unseen datasets was carried out through rigorous pairwise testing. The study also investigated the nature of features that are most likely to train classifiers that can generalize well with the data. Finally, the issue of class imbalance, which arises due to some tumour types being more common than others, was explored. For each of the tests carried out through pairwise testing, the optimal area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged between 76% and 86%, suggesting that the model was able to capture transferable tumour information. Feature selection results suggest that similar aspects of tumour texture are enhanced by MR images obtained at different hospitals. Our results also suggest that the availability of equally represented classes has enabled SVM to better characterize the data points. The findings of the study presented here support the use of 3D TA on conventional MR images to aid diagnostic classification of paediatric brain tumours.

This is especially true when data is not only imbalanced but also high dimensional. The class imbalance is very often accompanied by a high dimensionality of datasets and in such aÂ case these problems should be considered together. Traditional feature selection methods usually assign the same weighting to samples from different classes when the samples are used to evaluate each feature. Therefore, they do not work good enough with imbalanced data. In situation when the costs of misclassification of different classes are diverse, cost-sensitive learning methods are often applied. These methods are usually used in the classification phase, but we propose to take the cost factors into consideration during the feature selection.

The first data-set is used to predict the response of students with autism while they learn a specific task, whereas the second one is used to predict students’ failure at a secondary school. The two data-sets suffer from two major problems that can negatively impact the ability of classification models to predict the correct label; class imbalance and class noise. A series of experiments have been carried out to improve the quality of training data, and hence improve prediction results. In this paper, we propose two noise filter methods to eliminate the noisy instances from the majority class located inside the borderline area. Our methods combine the over-sampling SMOTE technique with the thresholding technique to balance the training data and choose the best boundary between classes. Then we apply a noise detection approach to identify the noisy instances. We have used the two data-sets to assess the efficacy of class-imbalance approaches as well as both proposed methods.

These minority instances have a tendency to be misclassified due to their tiny portion in a dataset. For a binary classification, they are labeled as positive while the rest are labeled as negative. This research proposes the novel parameter-free oversampling technique called the extreme anomalous oversampling technique, EXOT, based on an extreme anomalous score, EAS, and a negative anomalous score, NAS. This technique is used for rebalancing a data distribution that can be classified by any classifier. EAS of the instance p is the largest radius of an open ball centering at p containing only a single instance while NAS is the largest radius of an open ball centering at p without negative instances. EXOT synthesizes positive instances surrounding the original positive one using these two EAS and NAS. This work was conducted with three UCI datasets comparing SMOTE, borderline-SMOTE, safe-level SMOTE, and EXOT based on four classifiers which are C4.5, K-nearest neighbor classifier, multilayer perceptron, and naïve Bayes using precision, recall, F1-measure, and G-mean as performance measures.

In this paper we describe a novel resampling technique focused on proper detection of minority examples in a two-class imbalanced data task.

In bioinformatics, there is such a problem in the computational prediction of novel microRNA (miRNAs) within a full genome. The well-known precursors miRNA (pre-miRNA) are usually only a few in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of potential candidates, which makes this task a high class imbalance classification problem. It is well-known that high class imbalance usually affects any classical supervised machine learning classifier. Thus the imbalance must be explicitly considered. Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is a supervised artificial neural network model that has gained interest in the last years because of its high learning rate and performance. In this work, we propose a novel approach to overcome the high class imbalance in pre-miRNAs prediction data in which ELMs are used for predicting good candidates to pre-miRNA, without needing balanced data sets.

While feature selection and class imbalance learning have been widely studied in the literature, little study has jointly investigated them.

Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) have been proven to enhance quality of care by promoting change in prescription practices through antimicrobial selection advice. However, bypassing an initial assessment to determine the existence of an underlying disease that justifies the need of antimicrobial therapy might lead to indiscriminate and often unnecessary prescriptions.METHODS: From pathology laboratory tests, six biochemical markers were selected and combined with microbiology outcomes from susceptibility tests to create a unique dataset with over one and a half million daily profiles to perform infection risk inference. Outliers were discarded using the inter-quartile range rule and several sampling techniques were studied to tackle the class imbalance problem. The first phase selects the most effective and robust model during training using ten-fold stratified cross-validation. The second phase evaluates the final model after isotonic calibration in scenarios with missing inputs and imbalanced class distributions.RESULTS: More than 50% of infected profiles have daily requested laboratory tests for the six biochemical markers with very promising infection inference results: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.80-0.83), sensitivity (0.64-0.75) and specificity (0.92-0.97). Standardization consistently outperforms normalization and sensitivity is enhanced by using the SMOTE sampling technique. Furthermore, models operated without noticeable loss in performance if at least four biomarkers were available.CONCLUSION: The selected biomarkers comprise enough information to perform infection risk inference with a high degree of confidence even in the presence of incomplete and imbalanced data. Since they are commonly available in hospitals, Clinical Decision Support Systems could benefit from these findings to assist clinicians in deciding whether or not to initiate antimicrobial therapy to improve prescription practices.","Antimicrobial resistance; Behaviour change; Biochemical markers; Decision support; Infection; Machine learning; Predictive modelling; Supervised learning",

For both of the above purposes, it is essential to have a data set partitioned into a training set and a test set. In particular, the training set is used towards learning a model and the test set is then used towards evaluating the performance of the model learned from the training set. The split of the data into the two sets, however, and the influence on model performance, has only been investigated with respect to the optimal proportion for the two sets, with no attention paid to the characteristics of the data within the training and test sets. Thus, the current practice is to randomly split the data into approximately 70% for training and 30% for testing. In this paper, we show that this way of partitioning the data leads to two major issues: (a) class imbalance and (b) sample representativeness issues. Class imbalance is known to affect the performance of many classifiers by introducing a bias towards the majority class; the representativeness of the training set affects a model’s performance through the lack of opportunity for the algorithm to learn, by not presenting it with relevant examples—similar to testing a student on material that was not taught. To solve the above two issues, we propose a semi-random data partitioning framework, in the setting of granular computing. While we discuss how the framework can address both issues, in this paper, we focus on avoiding class imbalance when partitioning the data, through the proposed approach. The results show that avoiding class imbalance results in better model performance. © 2017, The Author(s).","Class imbalance; Data partition; Granular computing; Machine learning; Multi-granularity learning; Sample representativeness","Springer Nature"

Over the past few decades, several severity scoring systems and machine learning mortality prediction models have been developed for predicting hospital mortality. By contrast, early mortality prediction for intensive care unit patients remains an open challenge. Most research has focused on severity of illness scoring systems or data mining (DM) models designed for risk estimation at least 24 or 48 h after ICU admission. Objectives This study highlights the main data challenges in early mortality prediction in ICU patients and introduces a new machine learning based framework for Early Mortality Prediction for Intensive Care Unit patients (EMPICU). Materials and methods The proposed method is evaluated on the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care II (MIMIC-II) database. Mortality prediction models are developed for patients at the age of 16 or above in Medical ICU (MICU), Surgical ICU (SICU) or Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit (CSRU). We employ the ensemble learning Random Forest (RF), the predictive Decision Trees (DT), the probabilistic Naive Bayes (NB) and the rule-based Projective Adaptive Resonance Theory (PART) models. The primary outcome was hospital mortality. The explanatory variables included demographic, physiological, vital signs and laboratory test variables. Performance measures were calculated using cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) to minimize bias. 11,722 patients with single ICU stays are considered. Only patients at the age of 16 years old and above in Medical ICU (MICU), Surgical ICU (SICU) or Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit (CSRU) are considered in this study. Results The proposed EMPICU framework outperformed standard scoring systems (SOFA, SAPS-I, APACHE-II, NEWS and qSOFA) in terms of AUROC and time (i.e. at 6 h compared to 48 h or more after admission). Discussion and conclusion The results show that although there are many values missing in the first few hour of ICU admission, there is enough signal to effectively predict mortality during the first 6 h of admission. The proposed framework, in particular the one that uses the ensemble learning approach – EMPICU Random Forest (EMPICU-RF) offers a base to construct an effective and novel mortality prediction model in the early hours of an ICU patient admission, with an improved performance profile. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Class imbalance; Classification; Intensive care; Mortality prediction; Random Forest","Elsevier Ireland Ltd"

That is, more misclassifications for the majority class examples are equivalent to a greater number of minority class examples. Executing the SVM as a preprocessor can be used to overcome the class imbalanced problem. Sequentially, the modified dataset undergoes the random forest to defy the curse of dimensionality.

The procedure of PBI simply consists of two steps: an (imbalanced) NN learning method is first applied to produce a classification boundary, which is then adjusted by PBI under the geometric mean (G-mean). For data imbalance, the geometric mean of the accuracies of both minority and majority classes is considered, that is statistically more suitable than the common metric accuracy. PBI also has the following advantages over traditional imbalance methods: (i) PBI can significantly improve the classification accuracy on minority class while improving or keeping that on majority class as well; (ii) PBI is suitable for large data even with high imbalance ratio (up to 0.001). For evaluation of (i), a new metric called Majority loss/Minority advance ratio (MMR) is proposed that evaluates the loss ratio of majority class to minority class. Experiments have been conducted for PBI and several imbalance learning methods over benchmark datasets of different sizes, different imbalance ratios, and different dimensionalities. By analyzing the experimental results, PBI is shown to outperform other imbalance learning methods on almost all datasets. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Boosting; Imbalance learning; SMOTE; Weighted ELM","Elsevier Ltd"

In this situation, some of current machine learning algorithms, e.g., support vector machine, will obtain weak classification performance, especially on minority class. To solve this problem, a new hybrid sampling online extreme learning machine (ELM) on sequential imbalanced data is proposed in this paper. The key idea is keeping the majority and minority classes balanced with similar sequential distribution characteristic of the original data. This method includes two stages. At the offline stage, we introduce the principal curve to build confidence regions of minority and majority classes respectively. Based on these two confidence zones, over-sampling of minority class and under-sampling of majority class are both conducted to generate new synthetic samples, and then, the initial ELM model is established. At the online stage, we first choose the most valuable ones from the synthetic samples of majority class in terms of sample importance. Afterwards, a new online fast leave-one-out cross validation (LOO CV) algorithm utilizing Cholesky decomposition is proposed to determine whether to update the ELM network weight at online stage or not. We also prove theoretically that the proposed method has upper bound of information loss. Experimental results on seven UCI datasets and one real-world air pollutant forecasting dataset show that, compared with ELM, OS-ELM, meta-cognitive OS-ELM, and OSELM with SMOTE strategy, the proposed method can simultaneously improve the classification performance of minority and majority classes in terms of accuracy, G-mean value, and ROC curve. As a conclusion, the proposed hybrid sampling online extreme learning machine can be effectively applied to the sequential data imbalance problem with better generalization performance and numerical stability. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Imbalance problem; Leave-one-out cross validation; Online sequential extreme learning machine; Principal curve","Springer New York LLC"

The results show that OmniGA systematically outperformed these models for all the considered datasets, reducing the F1 score error in the range from 100% to 2.25%, compared to the best performing model. This demonstrates that OmniGA produces robust models with improved performance.

This imbalance problem is almost ubiquitous in biological datasets. Resampling is one of the common methods to deal with the imbalanced dataset problem. In this study, we explore the learning performance by varying the balancing ratios of training datasets, consisting of the observed peptides and absent peptides in the Mass Spectrometry experiment on the different machine learning algorithms. It has been observed that the ideal balancing ratio has yielded better performance than the imbalanced dataset, but it was not the best as compared to some intermediate ratio. By experimenting using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) at different balancing ratios, we obtained the best results by achieving sensitivity of 92.1%, specificity value of 94.7%, overall accuracy of 93.4%, MCC of 0.869, and AUC of 0.982 with boosted random forest algorithm. This study also identifies the most discriminating features by applying the feature ranking algorithm. From the results of current experiments, it can be inferred that the performance of machine learning algorithms for the classification tasks can be enhanced by selecting optimally balanced training dataset, which can be obtained by suitably modifying the class distribution. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Imbalanced dataset; mass spectrometry; optimal balancing; random forest; real adaboost; SMOTE","World Scientific Publishing Co.

However, microarray gene expression data face the challenges of class imbalance and high dimension. The class imbalance problem usually leads to inaccurate results when using traditional feature selection and classification algorithms. Due to fast learning speed and good classification performance, extreme learning machine (ELM) has become one of the best classification algorithms and weighted ELM has been recently presented to deal with the class imbalance. However, they ignored the negative impact of imbalanced feature set. This paper proposes a hybrid method based on WELM to handle the multi class imbalance problem of cancer microarray data at both feature and algorithmic levels. At feature level, a corrected feature subset is searched for each class using class oriented feature selection method, so that the features correlated with the minority class are explicitly selected. At algorithmic level, WELM is further modified to strengthen the input nodes with high discrimination power, and an ensemble model is trained to improve the generalization. That is, multiple modified WELM models are trained on the datasets characterized by different feature subsets; in order to encourage the ensemble diversity, the models with low dissimilarity are removed and the reserved ones are combined as an ensemble model. The experiments are conducted on eight gene expression datasets with multiple cancer types and classification results show that our method significantly outperforms ELM and several recent works. © 2017","Ensemble learning; Extreme learning machine; Feature selection; High dimension; Multi class imbalance","Elsevier B.V."

Classification performance depends on the nature of the sample input datasets during the training of classifier. When data samples of one class are more than the data samples of other class, then it is called as imbalanced datasets. In such case, algorithms always favor classifying samples into the overrepresented (majority) class. Existing classification model are inefficient in recognizing samples of the underrepresented (minority) class, which is frequently the class of interest (the minority class). In this paper, Support vector machine with clustering is proposed for learning from imbalanced data in which multiple sub-datasets are built from majority class samples by cluster partitioning method such that each of these sub-dataset has an approximately equal number of samples as a minority class datasets. Then a number of SVM classifiers is developed so that each classifier is trained with a different majority subdatasets and the same minority datasets. Advantage of proposed approach is that there is no loss of valuable information and no overfitting problem because proposed approach is not removing or adding any samples to datasets. Proposed approach is evaluated on many datasets and its performance is compared with existing SVM. Based on an overall result, we can conclude that the proposed SVM with clustering method is very efficient method for class imbalance problem.

Transfer learning algorithms are used to build high-performance classifiers, when the training data has different distribution characteristics from the testing data. For a transfer learning environment, it is not possible to use validation techniques (such as cross validation or data splitting) to set the desired performance of a classifier, due to the lack of labeled training data from the test domain. As a result, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) performance measure may not be predictive of the actual classifier performance. In an environment where validation techniques are not possible, the relationship between AUC and classification accuracy is needed to better characterize transfer learning algorithm performance.

Crowdfunding has emerged as an exciting new mechanism for connecting startups with potentially thousands of investors. Nonetheless, little is known about its effectiveness, nor the strategies that entrepreneurs should adopt in order to maximize their rate of success. In this paper, we perform a longitudinal data collection and analysis of AngelList-a popular crowdfunding social platform for connecting investors and entrepreneurs. Over a 7-10 month period, we track companies that are actively fund-raising on AngelList, and record their level of social engagement on AngelList, Twitter, and Facebook. Through a series of measures on social engagement (e.g. number of tweets, posts, new followers), our analysis shows that active engagement on social media is highly correlated to crowdfunding success. In some cases, the engagement level is an order of magnitude higher for successful companies. We further apply attrange of machine learning techniques (e.g. decision tree, SVM, KNN, etc) to predict the ability of a company to successfully raise funding based on its social engagement and other metrics. Since fund-raising is attrare event, we explore various techniques to deal with class imbalance issues. We observe that some metrics (e.g. AngelList followers and Facebook posts) are more significant than other metrics in predicting fund-raising success.

This paper proposed a cost-sensitive majority weighted minority oversampling strategy to address the imbalanced MWL data classification problem. Both the inter-class and intra-class imbalance problems are considered. For the former, imbalance ratio is defined to determine the number of the synthetic samples in the minority class. The latter problem is addressed by assigning different weights to borderline samples in the minority class based on the distance and density meaures of the sample distribution. Furthermore, multi-label classifier is designed based on an ensemble of binary classifiers. The results of analyzing 21 imbalanced UCI multi-class datasets showed that the proposed approach can effectively cope with the imbalanced classification problem in terms of several performance metrics including geometric mean (G-mean) and average accuracy (ACC). Moreover, the proposed approach was applied to the analysis of the EEG data of eight experimental participants subject to fluctuating levels of mental workload.

These sequences are usually named candidates to miRNA. The well-known pre-miRNAs are usually only a few in comparison to the hundreds of thousands of potential candidates to miRNA that have to be analyzed, which makes this task a high class-imbalance classification problem. The classical way of approaching it has been training a binary classifier in a supervised manner, using well-known pre-miRNAs as positive class and artificially defining the negative class. However, although the selection of positive labeled examples is straightforward, it is very difficult to build a set of negative examples in order to obtain a good set of training samples for a supervised method. In this work, we propose a novel and effective way of approaching this problem using machine learning, without the definition of negative examples. The proposal is based on clustering unlabeled sequences of a genome together with well-known miRNA precursors for the organism under study, which allows for the quick identification of the best candidates to miRNA as those sequences clustered with known precursors. Furthermore, we propose a deep model to overcome the problem of having very few positive class labels. They are always maintained in the deep levels as positive class while less likely pre-miRNA sequences are filtered level after level. Our approach has been compared with other methods for pre-miRNAs prediction in several species, showing effective predictivity of novel miRNAs. Additionally, we will show that our approach has a lower training time and allows for a better graphical navegability and interpretation of the results.

However, existing studies have yet to demonstrate a method of predicting the number of defects in an upcoming product release. This paper presents such a method using predictor variables derived from the defect acceleration, namely, the defect density, defect velocity, and defect introduction time, and determines the correlation of each predictor variable with the number of defects. We report the application of an integrated machine learning approach based on regression models constructed from these predictor variables. An experiment was conducted on ten different data sets collected from the PROMISE repository, containing 22 838 instances. The regression model constructed as a function of the average defect velocity achieved an adjusted R-square of 98.6%, with a p-value of < 0.001. The average defect velocity is strongly positively correlated with the number of defects, with a correlation coefficient of 0.98. Thus, it is demonstrated that this technique can provide a blueprint for program testing to enhance the effectiveness of software development activities. © 2013 IEEE.","class imbalance; defect velocity; machine learning; number of defects; Software defect prediction","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Therefore, the process of prediction on the success rate of students should be done as early as possible in order to reduce the impact of the problem. The prediction process is done using various methods of data mining based on the classification pattern of the dataset to be processed. In the process, these datasets often have an unbalanced class distribution, it can be a serious constraint when applied to various algorithms for data classification. Therefore, this study discusses the handling of the dataset imbalance using a combination of the SMOTE and OSS methods. The SMOTE and OSS methods work by balancing the distribution of classes on the dataset, this will increase the value of g-mean when implemented on various classification algorithms. In the experiment, the classification algorithms used in this research are, K-NN, Naïve Bayes, and SVM. From the test result, the combination of SMOTE and OSS method can increase the g-mean value of KNN algorithm from 85,519% to 89,367%, Naïve Bayes algorithm from 82,482% to 85,416% and SVM algorithm from 85,829% to 96,503%.

However, the fact that instability events rarely occur would lead to a challenging class imbalance problem. Besides, short-term feature extraction from scarce instability seems extremely difficult for conventional learning machines. Faced with such a dilemma, this paper develops a systematic imbalance learning machine for online short-term voltage stability assessment. A powerful time series shapelet (discriminative subsequence) classification method is embedded into the machine for sequential transient feature mining. A forecasting-based nonlinear synthetic minority oversampling technique is proposed to mitigate the distortion of class distribution. Cost-sensitive learning is employed to intensify bias toward those scarce yet valuable unstable cases. Furthermore, an incremental learning strategy is put forward for online monitoring, contributing to adaptability and reliability enhancement along with time.

To improve their performance in these kind of problems, a low-cost post-processing strategy is proposed based on calculating a new bias to adjust the function learned by the SVM. The proposed bias will consider the proportional size between classes in order to improve performance on the minority class. This solution avoids not only introducing and tuning new parameters, but also modifying the standard optimization problem for SVM training.

Box 11421, Helwan, Egypt","Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in the Arabian Gulf region, especially among women. Recent studies show that the vitamin D deficiency is associated with a mineral status of a patient. Therefore, it is important to assess the mineral status of the patient to reveal the hidden mineral imbalance associated with vitamin D deficiency. A well-known test such as the red blood cells is fairly expensive, invasive, and less informative. On the other hand, a hair mineral analysis can be considered an accurate, excellent, highly informative tool to measure mineral imbalance associated with vitamin D deficiency. In this study, 118 apparently healthy Kuwaiti women were assessed for their mineral levels and vitamin D status by a hair mineral analysis (HMA). This information was used to build a computerized model that would predict vitamin D deficiency based on its association with the levels and ratios of minerals. The first phase of the proposed model introduces a novel hybrid optimization algorithm, which can be considered as an improvement of Bat Algorithm (BA) to select the most discriminative features. The improvement includes using the mutation process of Genetic Algorithm (GA) to update the positions of bats with the aim of speeding up convergence; thus, making the algorithm more feasible for wider ranges of real-world applications. Due to the imbalanced class distribution in our dataset, in the second phase, different sampling methods such as Random Under-Sampling, Random Over-Sampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique are used to solve the problem of imbalanced datasets. In the third phase, an AdaBoost ensemble classifier is used to predicting the vitamin D deficiency. The results showed that the proposed model achieved good results to detect the deficiency in vitamin D. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","AdaBoost classifier; Bat Algorithm (BA); Classification; Genetic Algorithm (GA); Imbalanced data; Optimization algorithm; Random sampling; Vitamin D deficiency","Elsevier Ltd"

In binary classification tasks, one class usually tends to be underrepresented when it consists of far fewer patterns than the other class, which results in undesirable classification results, especially for the minority class. Several techniques, including resampling, boosting and cost-sensitive methods have been proposed to alleviate this problem. Recently, some ensemble methods that focus on combining individual techniques to obtain better performance have been observed to present better classification performance on the minority class. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble framework called Adaptive Ensemble Undersampling-Boost for imbalanced learning. Our proposal combines the Ensemble of Undersampling (EUS) technique, Real Adaboost, cost-sensitive weight modification, and adaptive boundary decision strategy to build a hybrid algorithm. The superiority of our method over other state-of-the-art ensemble methods is demonstrated by experiments on 18 real world data sets with various data distributions and different imbalance ratios. Given the experimental results and further analysis, our proposal is proven to be a promising alternative that can be applied to various imbalanced classification domains. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Adaptive decision boundary; Classification; Ensemble Undersampling; Imbalanced data sets; Real Adaboost; Voting algorithm","Elsevier Inc."

It is notably difficult to develop an effective model using current data mining and machine learning algorithms without considering data preprocessing to balance the imbalanced data sets. Random undersampling and oversampling have been used in numerous studies to ensure that the different classes contain the same number of data points. A classifier ensemble (i.e. a structure containing several classifiers) can be trained on several different balanced data sets for later classification purposes. In this paper, we introduce two undersampling strategies in which a clustering technique is used during the data preprocessing step. Specifically, the number of clusters in the majority class is set to be equal to the number of data points in the minority class. The first strategy uses the cluster centers to represent the majority class, whereas the second strategy uses the nearest neighbors of the cluster centers. A further study was conducted to examine the effect on performance of the addition or deletion of 5 to 10 cluster centers in the majority class. The experimental results obtained using 44 small-scale and 2 large-scale data sets revealed that the clustering-based undersampling approach with the second strategy outperformed five state-of-the-art approaches. Specifically, this approach combined with a single multilayer perceptron classifier and C4.5 decision tree classifier ensembles delivered optimal performance over both small- and large-scale data sets. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Class imbalance; Classifier ensembles; Clustering; Imbalanced data; Machine learning","Elsevier Inc."

As a natural approach to this issue, oversampling balances the training samples through replicating existing samples or synthesizing new samples. In general, synthesization outperforms replication by supplying additional information on the minority class. However, the additional information needs to follow the same normal distribution of the training set, which further constrains the new samples within the predefined range of training set. In this paper, we present the Wiener process oversampling (WPO) technique that brings the physics phenomena into sample synthesization. WPO constructs a robust decision region by expanding the attribute ranges in training set while keeping the same normal distribution. The satisfactory performance of WPO can be achieved with much lower computing complexity. In addition, by integrating WPO with ensemble learning, the WPOBoost algorithm outperformsmany prevalent imbalance learning solutions. © 2016, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","AdaBoost; ensemble learning; imbalanced-data learning; oversampling; Wiener process","Higher Education Press"

Traditional experimental approaches are often expensive and time-consuming. Consequently, a growing number of research efforts employ a series of machine learning approaches to predict the subcellular location of proteins. There are two main challenges among the state-of-the-art prediction methods. First, most of the existing techniques are designed to deal with multi-class rather than multi-label classification, which ignores connections between multiple labels. In reality, multiple locations of particular proteins imply that there are vital and unique biological significances that deserve special focus and cannot be ignored. Second, techniques for handling imbalanced data in multi-label classification problems are necessary, but never employed.

In addition to the former, when instances are located into the overlapped areas, the correct modeling of the problem becomes harder. Current solutions for both issues are often focused on the binary case study, as multi-class datasets require an additional effort to be addressed. In this research, we overcome these problems by carrying out a combination between feature and instance selections. Feature selection will allow simplifying the overlapping areas easing the generation of rules to distinguish among the classes. Selection of instances from all classes will address the imbalance itself by finding the most appropriate class distribution for the learning task, as well as possibly removing noise and difficult borderline examples.

The misclassification of such instances is much expensive because they are the most intended. Another fact is that there is a significant concentration on the binary class imbalance problem, while multiclass datasets have been received less consideration. The main aim of this paper is at getting a more precise assignment of the few or the rare examples to their minority classes via presenting a novel hierarchical model based on Support Vector Machine (SVM) and MultiSVM. The model works using a new Algorithm (we call it Grouping Algorithm, it is not clustering) to create new balanced artificial groups from the original imbalanced classes, then heals the multiclass situation and carries out classification process through hierarchical steps. The model is tested with and without adding weights during classification process as well as the support vector machine, so results of the four machines are compared. The experiments are performed on nine Multiclass imbalanced datasets from U.C.I Repository from different fields and characteristics. When applying the proposed hierarchical model without weight, it achieves the best results in 4 out of 9 datasets in terms of Accuracy and kappa.

In contrast to conventional (static), data-driven multi-class machine learning (ML), we exploit process knowledge in order to constrain our classification system yielding more parsimonious models compared to static ML approaches. In particular, we enforce unidirectionality on a set of binary, multivariate classifiers trained to discriminate between adjacent feed phases by linking the classifiers through a one-way switch. The switch is activated when the actual classifier output changes. As a consequence, the next binary classifier in the classifier chain is used for the discrimination between the next feed phase pair etc. We allow activation of the switch only after a predefined number of consecutive predictions of a transition event in order to prevent premature activation of the switch and undertake a sensitivity analysis regarding the optimal choice of the (time) lag parameter. From a complexity/parsimony perspective the benefit of our approach is three-fold: i) The multi-class learning task is broken down into binary subproblems which usually have simpler decision surfaces and tend to be less susceptible to the class-imbalance problem. ii) We exploit the fact that the process follows a rigid feed cycle structure (i.e. batch-feed-batch-feed) which allows us to focus on the subproblems involving phase transitions as they occur during the process while discarding off-transition classifiers and iii) only one binary classifier is active at the time which keeps effective model complexity low. We further use a combination of logistic regression and Lasso (i.e. regularized logistic regression, RLR) as a wrapper to extract the most relevant features for individual subproblems from the whole set of high-dimensional sensor data. We train different soft computing classifiers, including decision trees (DT), k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machines (SVM) and an own developed fuzzy classifier and compare our method with conventional multi-class ML. Our results show a remarkable out-performance of the here proposed method over static ML approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness. We achieved close to error free feed phase classification while reducing the misclassification rates in 17 out of 20 investigated test cases in the range between 39% and 98.2% depending on feature set and classifier architecture. Models trained on features based on selection by RLR significantly outperformed those trained on features suggested by experts and their predictive performance was considerably less affected by the choice of the lag parameter. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-chemical reactors; Dynamic classification; Feed phase identification; Fermentation process; Fuzzy classifier; Regularized logistic regression","Elsevier B.V."

Sometimes they can even lead to Postpartum Depression (PPD). If left untreated, PPD can be debilitating for the mother and can adversely affect her ability to take care of herself and her infant. Since PPD is not clinically diagnosable, we consider the problem of predicting PPD from survey data about demographics, depression, and pregnancy etc. We adapt the successful functional-gradient boosting algorithm that can handle class imbalance in a principled manner. Our results demonstrate that the proposed machine learning approach can outperform the baseline classifiers and, consequently, demonstrate the potential of machine learning in predicting PPD. © 2017 IEEE.","Machine learning; Post Partum Depression","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

At present, the imbalanced data that have anomalous class distribution and underrepresented data are difficult to deal with through a variety of conventional machine learning technologies. In order to balance class distributions, an adaptive subspace self-organizing map (ASSOM) that combines the local mapping scheme and globally competitive rule is proposed to artificially generate synthetic samples focusing on minority class samples. The ASSOM is conformed with feature-invariant characteristics, including translation, scaling and rotation, and it retains the independence of basis vectors in each module. Specifically, basis vectors generated via each ASSOM module can avoid generating repeated representative features that offer nothing but heavy computational load. Several experimental results demonstrate that the proposed ASSOM method with supervised learning manner is superior to other existing oversampling techniques. © 2016 IEEE.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, the high dimension of the output of such technologies and the characteristics of the data sets analysed represent an issue for the classification task. Here we present a new feature selection method based on three steps to detect class-specific biomarkers in case of high-dimensional data sets. The first step detects the differentially expressed genes according to the experimental conditions tested in the experimental design, the second step filters out the features with low discriminative power and the third step detects the class-specific features and defines the final biomarker as the union of the class-specific features. The proposed procedure is tested on two microarray datasets, one characterized by a strong imbalance between the size of classes and the other one where the size of classes is perfectly balanced. We show that, using the proposed feature selection procedure, the classification performances of a Support Vector Machine on the imbalanced data set reach a 82% whereas other methods do not exceed 73%. Furthermore, in case of perfectly balanced dataset, the classification performances are comparable with other methods. Finally, the Gene Ontology enrichments performed on the signatures selected with the proposed pipeline, confirm the biological relevance of our methodology.

Many traditional machine learning methods are hard to improve the classification accuracy effectively while solving these problems. To get fast and efficient classification, a new online sequential extreme learning machine algorithm with sparse-weighting strategy is proposed to increase the accuracy of minority class while reducing the accuracy loss of majority class as much as possible. The main idea is integrating a new sparse-weighting strategy into the present data-based strategy for sequential data imbalance problem. In offline stage, a two phase balanced strategies is introduced to obtain the valuable virtual sample set. In online stage, a dynamic weighting strategy is proposed to assign the corresponding weight for each sequential sample by means of the change of sensitivity and specificity in order to maintain the optimal network structure.

However, the Web of Data is also characterized by various forms of uncertainty, owing to its inherent incompleteness (missing information, uneven data distributions) and noise, which may affect open and distributed architectures. In this paper, we focus on the inductive instance retrieval task regarded as a classification problem. The proposed solution is a framework for learning Terminological Decision Trees from examples described in an ontological knowledge base, to be used for performing instance classifications. For the purpose, suitable pruning strategies and a new prediction procedure are proposed. Furthermore, in order to tackle the class-imbalance distribution problem, the framework is extended to ensembles of Terminological Decision Trees called Terminological Random Forests. The proposed framework has been evaluated, in comparative experiments, with the main state of the art solutions grounded on a similar approach, showing that: (1) the employment of the formalized pruning strategies can improve the model predictiveness; (2) Terminological Random Forests outperform the usage of a single Terminological Decision Tree, particularly when the knowledge base is endowed with a large number of concepts and roles; (3) the framework can be exploited for solving related problems, such as predicting the values of given properties with finite ranges. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Concept learning; Decision tree; Imbalance learning; Inductive query answering; Membership prediction; Random forest; Web ontologies","Elsevier B.V."

A series of incidents have shown that the security threats caused by Twitter spam can reach far beyond the social media platform to impact the real world. To mitigate the threat, a lot of recent studies apply machine learning techniques to classify Twitter spam and promising results are reported. However, most of these studies overlook the class imbalance problem in real-world Twitter data. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate that the unequal distribution between spam and non-spam classes has a great impact on spam detection rate. To address the problem, we propose FOS, a fuzzy-based oversampling method that generates synthetic data samples from limited observed samples based on the idea of fuzzy-based information decomposition. Moreover, we develop an ensemble learning approach that learns more accurate classifiers from imbalanced data in three steps. In the first step, the class distribution in the imbalanced data set is adjusted by using various strategies, including random oversampling, random undersampling and FOS. In the second step, a classification model is built upon each of the redistributed data sets. In the final step, a majority voting scheme is introduced to combine the predictions from all the classification models. We conduct experiments on real-world Twitter data for the purpose of evaluation.

One main advantage of such a method is that it provides a prediction region potentially with multiple predicted labels, which contrasts to the single valued (regression) or single label (classification) output predictions by standard QSAR modeling algorithms. Standard conformal prediction might not be suitable for imbalanced data sets. Therefore, Mondrian cross-conformal prediction (MCCP) which combines the Mondrian inductive conformal prediction with cross-fold calibration sets has been introduced. In this study, the MCCP method was applied to 18 publicly available data sets that have various imbalance levels varying from 1:10 to 1:1000 (ratio of active/inactive compounds). Our results show that MCCP in general performed well on bioactivity data sets with various imbalance levels. More importantly, the method not only provides confidence of prediction and prediction regions compared to standard machine learning methods but also produces valid predictions for the minority class. In addition, a compound similarity based nonconformity measure was investigated.

A combination of Active Learning (ACL) and Imbalanced Class Learning (ICL) was used to address past problems with ML to develop a more efficient feature selection process and address the imbalance problem in all genomic data sets. The power of this novel ML approach and our ability to predict epigenetic phenomena and associated disease is suggested.

Decision tree is a type of machine learning method that can overcome missing values or outlier problems. Despite its simple application, it can accurately predict complex natural phenomena. To improve the robustness of the model, we used ensemble methods such as Bagging, AdaBoost, and Random Forest, and the performance of each method was compared against that of a single decision tree. The indicators of cyanobacterial blooms, namely chlorophyll-a concentration and cyanobacteria cell count, were classified into either the non-exceedance or the exceedance class according to administrative guidelines or criteria, and used as the response variables. Since the cyanobacteria cell count in the exceedance class was much smaller than that in the non-exceedance class, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used to mitigate the imbalance between classes. The prediction abilities for chlorophyll-a and cyanobacteria were evaluated based on multiple indices, including area under curve (AUC).

This paper presents a method named OCS-BWELM (objective cost-sensitive-boosting-WELM) to handle multi class imbalance. It takes boosting WELM as the basic learning algorithm. The misclassification costs are determined by the distributions of the given data rather than being defined subjectively. More specifically, it seeks optimal costs through maximizing the mutual information between real targets and prediction outputs. A specific feature of OCS-BWELM is that its costs are objective. Experiments are carried out to compare our method against existing ELM related works on handling multi class imbalance. Results show that our method could achieve a better performance balance between minority class and majority class than boosting WELM. And it outperforms others in terms of G-mean, F-score and F-measures of minority classes in most cases. © 2017 IEEE.","Boosting; ELM; Misclassification cost; Multi class imbalance","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

In Brazil, the health insurance companies implement a claim authorization process which assists in the detection of fraud and abuse. This process consists of a prior analysis of the services requested by providers, allowing them to detect patterns linked to fraud and abuse. This analysis is commonly performed manually, making the execution expensive and non-scalable. Health insurance companies have invested in the use of data mining and machine learning techniques to detect suspicious fraudulent patterns. However, the use of these techniques in claim authorization process is affected by the class imbalance problem, due to the fact that there are much more authorized service requests than unauthorized ones. This paper presents the investigation results of the effects of class imbalance in health insurance claims authorization domain. By means of an experiment, the performance loss of several classifiers was measured in different class distributions and also the performance recovery provided by treatment methods. The results show that the studied classification algorithms are affected differently by class imbalance. They also show that the recovery performance is lower the higher the class imbalance. © 2017 IEEE.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Imbalanced datasets exist in many domains, such as: fraud detection, sentiment analysis, churn prediction, and intrusion detection in computer networks. To solve the imbalance problem, three main approaches are typically used: data resampling, method adaptation and cost-sensitive learning; of these, data resampling, either oversampling the minority class instances or undersampling the majority class instances, is the most used approach. However, in most cases, when implementing these approaches, there is a trade-off between the predictive performance and the complexity. In this paper we introduce a fast, novel clustering-based undersampling technique for addressing binary-class imbalance problems, which demonstrates high predictive performance, while its time complexity is bound by the size of the minority class instances. During the training phase, the algorithm clusters the minority instances and selects a similar number of majority instances from each cluster. A specific classifier is then trained for each cluster. An unlabeled instance is classified as the majority class if it does not fit into any of the clusters. Otherwise, cluster-specific classifiers are used to return the instance's classification, and the results are weighted by the inverse-distance from the clusters. Our evaluation includes several state-of-the-art methods. We plot the Pareto frontier for various datasets, to consider both computational cost and predictive performance measures. Extensive sets of experiments demonstrate that only the suggested method is always found on the frontier. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Classification; Data mining; Data partitioning; Imbalanced data distribution; Undersampling","Elsevier B.V."

The new avenues of NoSQL Big Data compared to the traditional forms has insisted on adapting experimental beds, helping to discover large unknown values from enormous data sets. Also, outmoded management systems and statistical packages express trouble handling Big Data. In numerous real applications, handling of imbalanced data sets is the fact of precedence. The classification of data sets having imbalanced class distribution has produced a notable drawback in performance obtained by the most standard classifier learning algorithms. Assuming balanced class distribution and equal misclassification costs lead to poor results. In a real-world domain, the classification methods of multi-class imbalance problem need more attention compared to the two-class problem. A methodology is presented for binary/multi-class imbalanced data sets with improved over-sampling (O. S.) techniques to enhance classification. The methods are broadly classified into two categories: non-clustered and cluster based advanced approach compared to prior work on O. S. techniques. The balanced data are subsequently analyzed for classification using various classifiers.

Previous studies in supervised classification of satellite images have tackled specific class mapping problem by isolating the classes of interest and combining all other classes into one large class, usually called others, and by developing a binary classifier to discriminate the class of interest from the others. Here, this approach is called focused approach. The strength of the focused approach is to decompose the original multi-class supervised classification problem into a binary classification problem, focusing the process on the discrimination of the class of interest. Previous studies have shown that this method is able to discriminate more accurately the classes of interest when compared with the standard multi-class supervised approach. However, it may be susceptible to data imbalance problems present in the training data set, since the classes of interest are often a small part of the training set. A result the classification may be biased towards the largest classes and, thus, be sub-optimal for the discrimination of the classes of interest. This study presents a way to minimize the effects of data imbalance problems in specific class mapping using cost-sensitive learning. In this approach errors committed in theminority class are treated as being costlier than errors committed in the majority class. Cost-sensitive approaches are typically implemented by weighting training data points accordingly to their importance to the analysis. By changing the weight of individual data points, it is possible to shift theweight from the larger classes to the smaller ones, balancing the data set. To illustrate the use of the cost-sensitive approach to map specific classes of interest, a series of experiments with weighted support vector machines classifier and Landsat Thematic Mapper data were conducted to discriminate two types of mangrove forest (high-mangrove and low-mangrove) in Saloum estuary, Senegal, a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation World Heritage site. Results suggest an increase in overall classification accuracy with the use of cost-sensitive method (97.3%) over the standard multi-class (94.3%) and the focused approach (91.0%). In particular, cost-sensitive method yielded higher sensitivity and specificity values on the discrimination of the classes of interest when compared with the standard multi-class and focused approaches. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd."

Our work addresses the so-called Class Imbalance Problem through the utilization of an Artificial Immune System-(AIS)based classification algorithm which encodes the inherent ability of the Adaptive Immune System to mediate the exceptionally imbalanced ""self""/""non-self"" discrimination process. From a computational point of view, this process constitutes an extremely imbalanced pattern classification task since the vast majority of molecular patterns pertain to the ""non-self"" space. Our work focuses on investigating the effect of the class imbalance problem on the AIS-based classification algorithm by assessing its relative ability to deal with extremely skewed datasets when compared against two state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). To this end, we conducted a series of experiments on a music-related dataset where a small fraction of positive samples was to be recognized against the vast volume of negative samples. The results obtained indicate that the utilized bio-inspired classifier outperforms SVMs in detecting patterns from the minority class while its performance on the same task is competently close to the one exhibited by MLPs. Our findings suggest that the AIS-based classifier relies on its intrinsic resampling and class-balancing functionality in order to address the class imbalance problem. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Artificial immune systems; class imbalance problem; MLPs; SVMs","World Scientific Publishing Co.

The members of the CDKI protein family play important roles in many processes like tumor suppression, apoptosis, transcriptional regulation. The sequence similarity-based search methods to annotate putative CDKIs do not yield optimal performance due to sequence diversity of CDKIs. As a consequence, machine learning-based models have become viable choices for predicting CDKI. In this work, we have developed a framework for handling the class imbalance factor (which is encountered very frequently in biological datasets) in order to enhance the prediction of CDKI through machine learning approaches. We have designed our experiments to achieve the optimal performance of machine learning-based methods in predicting CDKI by investigating the dataset-related prediction enhancement issues, like: (1) What should be the optimal class distribution ratio in the training set? (2) Should we oversample or undersample? (3) At what ratio, positive and negative samples should be oversampled or undersampled? and (4) How to select the best-performing classifier? We have addressed these issues through comparing the results from an imbalanced training set with training sets which are created at different resampling rates by using synthetic minority over-sampling technique and undersampling technique to have varied class distributions. The proposed framework resulted in 100 % sensitivity, 93.7 % specificity, 96.4 % accuracy, 0.929 MCC with 0.981 AUC using simple sequence-based features on a leave-one-out cross-validation test. The generalization ability of the trained model was further tested on four separate blind testing sets. Our work supports the fact that the performance of the algorithms can be enhanced by creating an optimal class distribution in the training set besides fine-tuning of the parameters of the algorithms. This optimal ratio of positive and negative samples in the training set is an important learning enhancement parameter for prediction models based on machine learning algorithms. © 2016, International Association of Scientists in the Interdisciplinary Areas and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","CDK inhibitors; Kernel logistic regression; Optimal class distribution; SMOTE; Undersampling","International Association of Scientists in the International Association of Scientists in the"

Common types include Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), Tubular carcinoma, Medullary carcinoma, and Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC). While detecting cancer, one important factor is mitotic count – showing how rapidly the cells are dividing. But the class imbalance problem, due to the small number of mitotic nuclei in comparison to the overwhelming number of non-mitotic nuclei, affects the performance of classification models. This work presents a two-phase model to mitigate the class biasness issue while classifying mitotic and non-mitotic nuclei in breast cancer histopathology images through a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). First, nuclei are segmented out using blue ratio and global binary thresholding. In Phase-1 a CNN is then trained on the segmented out 80×80 pixel patches based on a standard dataset. Hard non-mitotic examples are identified and augmented; mitotic examples are oversampled by rotation and flipping; whereas non-mitotic examples are undersampled by blue ratio histogram based k-means clustering. Based on this information from Phase-1, the dataset is modified for Phase-2 in order to reduce the effects of class imbalance. The proposed CNN architecture and data balancing technique yielded an F-measure of 0.79, and outperformed all the methods relying on specific handcrafted features, as well as those using a combination of handcrafted and CNN-generated features. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Breast cancer; Class imbalance; Convolutional neural networks; Deep learning; Histopathology; Mitosis count","Elsevier Ltd"

This study analyzed the influences of sampling bias and class imbalance on the performance of four common methods used in 10 models for seismic liquefaction-Bayesian network (BN), artificial neural network (ANN), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM)-using controlled experiments based on penetration test (SPT) data from 350 standard case histories. The data are divided into two data sets with class distributions of 150:150 and 200:100, which are separately stratified and sampled to obtain 11 different cases of distributions (10:90, 20:80, 25:75, 33:67, 40:60, 50:50, 60:40, 67:33, 75:25, 80:20, and 90:10) to quantify the predictive performance of the four models using statistical model validation metrics, such as overall accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, recall, and F-score. The experiments show that the best distribution of liquefaction samples for training is not a fixed point but, rather, a range. The authors suggest that the best range of sample distribution is from 1 to 1.5 (liquefaction/nonliquefaction) for the BN method, from 0.67 to 1 for the ANN method, approximately 0.5 for the LR model, and from 0.5 to 1 for the SVM method. Furthermore, oversampling technology was used to try to improve the predictive capability of the four models for two samples (10:90 and 90:10) with bad class imbalance and sampling bias. The predictive performance of the oversampled sample considerably improved over the original samples with bad class imbalance and sampling bias for the LR model and the SVM polynomial (SVM-Pol) model rather than for the BN maximum likelihood estimation (BN-MLE) model and the ANN radial basis function (ANN-RBF) model. In addition, in the fields with unknown real distribution of classes in the population, when a training sample contains severe class imbalance or sampling bias, the authors recommend that researchers choose an oversampled sample that has the same class distribution as the population of the collected data to ensure optimal performance. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Class imbalance; Oversampling; Probabilistic liquefaction models; Sampling bias","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)"

Methods: Single-voxel, Short echo time MRS data were collected from 90 patients with pilocytic astrocytoma (n = 42), medulloblastoma (n = 38), or ependymoma (n = 10). Both spectra and metabolite profiles were used to develop the learning algorithms.

Results: Use of imbalanced learning techniques improved the balanced accuracy rate (BAR) of all classification methods (average BAR over all classification methods for spectra: oversampled data = 0.81, original = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001; metabolite concentration: oversampled-data = 0.91, original = 0.75, P &lt; 0.0001). Performance of all classifiers in discriminating ependymomas increased when oversampled data were used compared with original data for both complete spectra (F-measure P &lt; 0.01) and metabolite profile (F-measure P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Imbalanced learning techniques improve the classification accuracy of childhood brain tumors from MRS where group sizes differ and facilitate the inclusion of rarer tumor types into clinical decision support systems.

Methods: 1693 CLIMB study patients were classified as increased EDSS≥1.5 (worsening) or not (nonworsening) at up to five years after baseline visit. Support vector machines (SVM) were used to build the classifier, and compared to logistic regression (LR) using demographic, clinical and MRI data obtained at years one and two to predict EDSS at five years follow-up. Results: Baseline data alone provided little predictive value. Clinical observation for one year improved overall SVM sensitivity to 62% and specificity to 65% in predicting worsening cases. The addition of one year MRI data improved sensitivity to 71% and specificity to 68%. Use of nonuniform misclassification costs in the SVM model, weighting towards increased sensitivity, improved predictions (up to 86%). Sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy improved minimally with additional follow-up data. Predictions improved within specific groups defined by baseline EDSS. LR performed more poorly than SVM in most cases. Race, family history of MS, and brain parenchymal fraction, ranked highly as predictors of the non-worsening group. Brain T2 lesion volume ranked highly as predictive of the worsening group. Interpretation: SVM incorporating short-term clinical and brain MRI data, class imbalance corrective measures, and classification costs may be a promising means to predict MS disease course, and for selection of patients suitable for more aggressive treatment regimens. © 2017 Zhao et al.

It is an undoubted fact that some years ago, textual information was spreading in manageable rates; however, nowadays, such information has overcome even the most ambiguous expectations and constantly grows within seconds. It is therefore quite complex to cope with the vast amount of textual data particularly if we also take the incremental production speed into account. Social media, e-commerce, news articles, comments and opinions are broadcasted on a daily basis. A rational solution, in order to handle the abundance of data, would be to build automated information processing systems, for analyzing and extracting meaningful patterns from text. The present paper focuses on sentiment analysis applied in Greek texts. Thus far, there is no wide availability of natural language processing tools for Modern Greek. Hence, a thorough analysis of Greek, from the lexical to the syntactical level, is difficult to perform. This paper attempts a different approach, based on the proven capabilities of gradient boosting, a well-known technique for dealing with high-dimensional data. The main rationale is that since English has dominated the area of preprocessing tools and there are also quite reliable translation services, we could exploit them to transform Greek tokens into English, thus assuring the precision of the translation, since the translation of large texts is not always reliable and meaningful. The new feature set of English tokens is augmented with the original set of Greek, consequently producing a high dimensional dataset that poses certain difficulties for any traditional classifier. Accordingly, we apply gradient boosting machines, an ensemble algorithm that can learn with different loss functions providing the ability to work efficiently with high dimensional data. Moreover, for the task at hand, we deal with a class imbalance issues since the distribution of sentiments in real-world applications often displays issues of inequality. For example, in political forums or electronic discussions about immigration or religion, negative comments overwhelm the positive ones. The class imbalance problem was confronted using a hybrid technique that performs a variation of under-sampling the majority class and over-sampling the minority class, respectively. Experimental results, considering different settings, such as translation of tokens against translation of sentences, consideration of limited Greek text preprocessing and omission of the translation phase, demonstrated that the proposed gradient boosting framework can effectively cope with both high-dimensional and imbalanced datasets and performs significantly better than a plethora of traditional machine learning classification approaches in terms of precision and recall measures. © 2016 by the authors.","Gradient boosting machines; High-dimensional data; Modern Greek; Sentiment analysis","MDPI AG"

Discolouration is a key aesthetic indicator visible to customers. Investigations to understand discolouration and iron failures in water supply systems require assessment of large quantities of disparate, inconsistent, multidimensional data from multiple corporate systems. A comprehensive data matrix was assembled for a seven year period across the whole of a UK water company (serving three million people). From this a novel data driven tool for assessment of iron risk was developed based on a yearly update and ranking procedure, for a subset of the best quality data. To avoid a ‘black box’ output, and provide an element of explanatory (human readable) interpretation, classification decision trees were utilised. Due to the very limited number of iron failures, results from many weak learners were melded into one high-quality ensemble predictor using the RUSBoost algorithm which is designed for class imbalance. Results, exploring simplicity vs predictive power, indicate enough discrimination between variable relationships in the matrix to produce ensemble decision tree classification models with good accuracy for iron failure estimation at District Management Area (DMA) scale. Two model variants were explored: ‘Nowcast’ (situation at end of calendar year) and ‘Futurecast’ (predict end of next year situation from this year’s data). The Nowcast 2014 model achieved 100% True Positive Rate (TPR) and 95.3% True Negative Rate (TNR), with 3.3% of DMAs classified High Risk for un-sampled instances. The Futurecast 2014 achieved 60.5% TPR and 75.9% TNR, with 25.7% of DMAs classified High Risk for un-sampled instances. The output can be used to focus preventive measures to improve iron compliance. © 2017, The Author(s).","Ensemble decision trees; Iron; Machine learning; RUSBoost; Water distribution systems; Water quality","Springer Netherlands"

Since conventional Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN) have been proven not to effectively handle imbalanced data, some improved learning machines including Fuzzy SVM (FSVM) have been proposed. FSVM applies a fuzzy membership to each training pattern such that different patterns can give different contributions to the learning machine. However, how to evaluate fuzzy membership becomes the key point to FSVM. Moreover, these learning machines present disadvantages to process matrix patterns. In order to process matrix patterns and to tackle the imbalance problem, this paper proposes an entropy-based matrix learning machine for imbalanced data sets, adopting the Matrix-pattern-oriented Ho–Kashyap learning machine with regularization learning (MatMHKS) as the base classifier. The new leaning machine is named EMatMHKS and its contributions are: (1) proposing a new entropy-based fuzzy membership evaluation approach which enhances the importance of patterns, (2) guaranteeing the importance of positive patterns and get a more flexible decision surface.

Different factor scores are computed by categorizing instances based on the SVM margin and are assigned to related instances. The SVM margin is used to define borderline and noisy instances, and the factor scores are assigned to only borderline instances and positive noise. The adjustment factor is then employed as a multiplier to the instance weight in the AdaBoost algorithm when learning a weighted SVM. Using 10 real class-imbalanced datasets, we compare the proposed method to a standard SVM and other SVMs combined with various sampling and boosting methods. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in terms of F-measure and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, which means that the proposed method is useful for relaxing the class-imbalance problem by addressing well-known degradation issues such as overlap, small disjunct, and data shift problems. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","AdaBoost; Class imbalance; Instance categorization; SVM; Weight adjustment","Elsevier Inc."

In addition, it is important to distinguish P2P botnet traffic from normal P2P traffic in order to find P2P malware and to immediately detect P2P botnets. Several approaches including port-based, signature-based, pattern-based, and statistics-based methods have been proposed to classify P2P and P2P botnet traffic. However, a single method alone cannot accurately classify both P2P and P2P botnet traffic. In this paper, we propose a hybrid traffic classifier that is composed of two stages. The first stage consists of a P2P traffic classifier that works in two steps. In the first step, a signature-based classifier is combined with connection heuristics, and in the second step, a statistics-based classifier is compensated by pattern heuristics.

Classifier transfers usually come with dataset shifts. To overcome dataset shifts in practical applications, we consider the limitations in computational resources in this paper for the adaptation of batch learning algorithms, like the support vector machine (SVM). Approach. We focus on data selection strategies which limit the size of the stored training data by different inclusion, exclusion, and further dataset manipulation criteria like handling class imbalance with two new approaches. We provide a comparison of the strategies with linear SVMs on several synthetic datasets with different data shifts as well as on different transfer settings with electroencephalographic (EEG) data. Main results. For the synthetic data, adding only misclassified samples performed astoundingly well. Here, balancing criteria were very important when the other criteria were not well chosen. For the transfer setups, the results show that the best strategy depends on the intensity of the drift during the transfer. Adding all and removing the oldest samples results in the best performance, whereas for smaller drifts, it can be sufficient to only add samples near the decision boundary of the SVM which reduces processing resources. Significance. For brain-computer interfaces based on EEG data, models trained on data from a calibration session, a previous recording session, or even from a recording session with another subject are used. We show, that by using the right combination of data selection criteria, it is possible to adapt the SVM classifier to overcome the performance drop from the transfer. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","brain-computer interface; electroencephalogram; incremental/decremental learning; movement prediction; online learning; P300; support vector machine","Institute of Physics Publishing"

In both analyses, a number of different inter-fraction and intra-fraction training strategies were studied, both offline as well as online, along with data sufficiency and skew compensation for class imbalances. The performance of different training strategies were compared across multiple machine learning classification algorithms, including nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, linear discriminant and ensemble Adaboost. The prediction performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall and the area under the curve (AUC) for repeater operating characteristics curve. The key results of the trend-based analysis indicate that (i) intra-fraction training strategies achieve highest prediction accuracies (90.5-91.4%); (ii) the predictive modeling yields lowest accuracies (50-60%) when the training data does not include any information from the test patient; (iii) the prediction latencies are as low as a few hundred milliseconds, and thus conducive for real-time prediction. The binary classification performance is promising, indicated by high AUCs (0.96-0.98). It also confirms the utility of prior data from previous patients, and also the necessity of training the classifier on some initial data from the new patient for reasonable prediction performance. The ability to predict a baseline shift with a sufficient look-ahead window will enable clinical systems or even human users to hold the treatment beam in such situations, thereby reducing the probability of serious geometric and dosimetric errors. © 2017 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","baseline shift; predictive modeling; respiratory tumor motion","Institute of Physics Publishing"

The traditional identification methods regard the smallest error rate as the goal while the imbalance of classes is ignored. This makes the positive class is overwhelming covered by the negative class and reduces its effect for the classifier, so that the classification results tend to recognize the negative class correctly, which severely affects the identification accuracy. In this paper, we mainly studied the class imbalance problems of true or false drugs via infrared spectral data of its, and then propose a balance cascading and sparse representation based classification method (BC-SRC) by combining the Balance Cascading with SRC. We sampling majority samples from the majority class for several times, which has the same size as minority samples and the majority samples we sampled can contain all the majority class samples entirely (sampling times is ceiling the result of majority samples number divide minority samples number). We can get sets of results, and then obtain the final predict labels form those results. Experiments of three databases achieved on Matlab2012a shows that the method is effective. From the experimental results, it can be seen that the method is superior to the commonly used Partial Least Squares (PLS), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) and BP. Particularly, for the imbalanced databases, when the imbalance factor is greater than 10, the proposed method has more stable performance with higher classification accuracy than the existing ones mentioned above. © 2017, Peking University Press.

They can cause low prediction accuracy and high computation costs. Active Learning is a technique that employs only a small set of data to construct an initial classification model. Then, it iteratively improves the model by incrementally learning from the misclassified examples. In this paper, we aim to improve prediction accuracy by applying Active Learning. To solve the imbalance issue, the active model was iteratively updated based on the G-mean, and the under sampling sampling was also applied. The proposed algorithm was suitable for large scale data since it did not need to use the whole data set to construct a model. The experiment was conducted on two standard corpuses, one of which contained more than 100,000 examples. The result showed that a prediction performance of standard technique (Neural Network) can be improved by applying the Active Learning strategy for 5%-13%.

In many real applications of bearings fault diagnosis, the data tend to be online imbalanced, which means, the number of fault data is much less than the normal data while they are all collected in online sequential way. Suffering from this problem, many traditional diagnosis methods will get low accuracy of fault data which acts as the minority class in the collected bearing data. To address this problem, an online sequential prediction method for imbalanced fault diagnosis problem is proposed based on extreme learning machine. This method introduces the principal curve and granulation division to simulate the flow distribution and overall distribution characteristics of fault data, respectively. Then a confident over-sampling and under-sampling process is proposed to establish the initial offline diagnosis model. In online stage, the obtained granules and principal curves are rebuilt on the bearing data which are arrived in sequence, and after the over-sampling and under-sampling process, the balanced sample set is formed to update the diagnosis model dynamically. A theoretical analysis is provided and proves that, even existing information loss, the proposed method has lower bound of the model reliability.

Due to the potentially unbounded number of instances arriving rapidly, evolving concepts and limitations imposed on utilized computational resources, there is a need to develop efficient and adaptive algorithms that can handle such problems. These learning difficulties can be further augmented by appearance of skewed distributions during the stream progress. Class imbalance in non-stationary scenarios is highly challenging, as not only imbalance ratio may change over time, but also relationships among classes. In this paper we propose an efficient and fast cost-sensitive decision tree learning scheme for handling online class imbalance. In each leaf of the tree we train a perceptron with output adaptation to compensate for skewed class distributions, while McDiarmid’s bound is used for controlling the splitting attribute selection. The cost matrix automatically adapts itself to the current imbalance ratio in the stream, allowing for a smooth compensation of evolving class relationships. Furthermore, we analyze characteristics of minority class instances and incorporate this information during the model update process. It allows our classifier to focus on most difficult instances, while a sliding window keeps track of changes in class structures.

There is a tremendous requirement to study data sets beyond the capability of commonly used software tools to capture, curate and manage within a tolerable elapsed time and also beyond the processing feasibility of the single machine architecture. In addition to the traditional structured data, the new avenue of NoSQL Big Data has urged a call to experimental techniques and technologies that require ventures to re-integrate. It helps to discover large hidden values from huge datasets that are complex, diverse and of a massive scale. In many of the real world applications, classification of imbalanced datasets is the point of priority concern. The standard classifier learning algorithms assume balanced class distribution and equal misclassification costs; as a result, the classification of datasets having imbalanced class distribution has produced a notable drawback in performance obtained by the most standard classifier learning algorithms. Most of the classification methods focus on two-class imbalance problem inspite of multi-class imbalance problem, which exist in real-world domains. A methodology is introduced for single-class/multi-class imbalanced data sets (Lowest vs. Highest—LVH) with enhanced over_sampling (O.S.) techniques (MEre Mean Minority Over_Sampling Technique—MEMMOT, Majority Minority Mix mean—MMMm, Nearest Farthest Neighbor_Mid—NFN-M, Clustering Minority Examples—CME, Majority Minority Cluster Based Under_Over Sampling Technique—MMCBUOS, Updated Class Purity Maximization—UCPM) to improve classification. The study is based on broadly two views: either to compare the enhanced non-cluster techniques to prior work or to have a clustering based approach for advance O.S. techniques. Finally, this balanced data is to be applied to form Random Forest (R.F.) tree for classification. O.S. techniques are projected to apply on imbalanced Big Data using mapreduce environment.

Here, we experiment with the so-called probabilistic sampling method that applies downsampling and up-sampling at the same time. For this, it defines a new class distribution for the training data, which is a linear combination of the original and the uniform class distributions. As an extension to previous studies, we propose a new method to re-estimate the class priors, which is required to remedy the mismatch between the training and the test data distributions introduced by re-sampling. Using probabilistic sampling and the proposed modification we report 5% and 6% relative error rate reductions on the TED-LIUM and on the AMI corpora, respectively.

The class imbalance problem arises when a dataset with a highly imbalanced class distribution is used within the training or evaluation process. In such cases, only measures, which are not biased by distribution of classes in datasets, should be used; however, they cannot be chosen arbitrarily. They should be selected so that their outcomes provide desired information; and simultaneously, they should allow a full comparison of just evaluated classifier performance along, with performances of other solutions. As is shown in this article, the dilemma with reporting performance of binary classifiers can be solved using so called class balanced measures. The class balanced measures are generally applicable means, appropriate for reporting performance of binary classifiers on balanced as well as on imbalanced datasets. On the basis of the presented pieces of information, a suggestion for a generally applicable, fully-valued, reporting of binary classifiers performance is given.","Binary classification; Class imbalance problem; Machine learning; Performance measures; Reporting of results","University of Pardubice"

With recent developments in clinical science and the availability of devices to capture heart beats, researchers are now exploring the possibility of a machine assisted heart sound analysis system that can augment the clinical expertise of the physician in early detection of CVD. In this paper, we study the application of machine learning algorithms in classifying abnormal/normal heart sounds based on the short (≤120 s) audio phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings. To this end, we use the largest public audio PCG dataset released as part of the 2016 PhysioNet/Cardiology in Computing Challenge. The data comes from different patients, most of who have had no previous history of cardiac disease and some with known cardiac diseases. In our study, we use these audio recordings to train three different classification algorithms and discuss the effects of class imbalance (normal vs. abnormal) on the precision-recall trade-off of the prediction task. Specifically, our goal is to find a suitable model that takes into account the inherent imbalance and optimize the precision-recall trade-off with a higher emphasis on increasing recall.

Among the methods which handle class imbalance problem, undersampling is a data level approach which preprocesses the data set to reduce the size of the majority class instances. Most of the existing undersampling methods apply either prototype selection or clustering techniques to balance the data set. They are effective and popular, but both processes are complex. Drawbacks of the cluster based undersampling methods are: The quality of the chosen majority class samples varies depending on clustering algorithm, number of clusters and also the convergence is difficult. Drawback of prototype selection methods is that they have to compare each majority instance with it’s k nearest neighbors to decide which majority class instance should be selected/discarded which is not only time consuming and is also difficult to implement for large datasets. Proposed undersampling method MahalanobisCentroidbasedUndersampingwithFilter (MahalCUSFilter) overcomes the above said problems: parameter dependence, complexity and information loss.

However, as with most machine learning methods, these networks suffer from the data imbalance problem - when the underlying training dataset is comprised of an unequal number of samples for each label/class. Such imbalance enforces a phenomena known as domain shift that causes the model to have poor generalisation when presented with previously unseen data. Recent research has focused on a technique called gradient sign that intensifies domain shift in CNNs by modifying inputs to deliberately yield erroneous model outputs, while appearing unmodified to human observers. Several commercial systems rely on image recognition techniques to perform well. Therefore, adversarial attacks poses serious threats to their integrity. In this work we present an experimental study that sheds light on the link between adversarial attacks, imbalanced learning and transfer learning. Through a series of experiments we evaluate the fast gradient sign method on class imbalanced CNNs, linking model vulnerabilities to the characteristics of its underlying training set and internal model knowledge. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adversarial examples; Convolutional neural networks; Gradient sign; Imbalanced training; Transfer learning","Springer Verlag"

Particularly, sudden changes in output, which could adversely affect the power system, are called ramps and may cause serious problems in the power system. In this paper, the authors discuss the ramp event forecast by using classifiers. A serious issue in this setup is that classification based forecast tends to be inaccurate since the occurrence of such a ramp is relatively rare. This problem is called the class imbalance problem in the machine learning field. To overcome the class imbalance problem in ramp forecast, several data sampling approaches are implemented. The effectiveness of these sampling approaches is experimentally evaluated by using a real-world wind power generation dataset. The results show that the implemented approaches drastically improved the forecast accuracy.","class imbalance problem; data sampling; forecast; ramp events; wind power","Elsevier Ltd"

This is mainly due to the high number of real applications that are affected by this situation. The adaptation of the standard decision trees to deal with imbalanced data represents one of the important number of approaches that have been developed to address this problem. This adaptation has been proposed under three different perspectives: splitting criterion, assignment rule and pruning. In this paper, we focus our attention to the pruning of decision trees. We propose an adaptation of the standard pruning algorithm MCCP to address the skewed-data problem. Our contribution affects two levels: adaption of the metric used in selecting nodes to be firstly pruned and change of the evaluation measure used in selecting the best decision-tree through the pruning set. Our goal is to show that, contrary to the popular belief in the literature enquiring into the uselessness of decision tree pruning, an adaptive pruning technique for imbalanced situations is more efficient and more accurate towards the minority class. A total of twelve binary class data-sets having different imbalance ratio are used to test the performance of the proposed method.

A dataset is said to be imbalance, if categories of the classification attribute is not evenly represented. A fine balanced dataset is an important source for the classifiers to define the best prediction model. All the existing classifiers are inclined to perform poor on the imbalanced datasets. The reason for this is, all the classifiers seek to optimize their overall accuracy not by considering the relative distribution of each class. Hence, it is very essential to go for well balanced dataset for classification. In this paper, the comprehensive Enhanced Minority Oversampling TEchnique (EMOTE) is proposed to improve the performance of the classifier by balancing the dataset. The key idea of the proposed method is to balance the dataset by tuning the misclassified instances of the minority classes into correctly classified instances through oversampling their nearest neighbor. To investigate the performance of the proposed model, different oversampling and under sampling methods inclusive of the well known method SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique) are considered. Various imbalanced datasets from the UCI machine learning repository are considered for experiments The experimental results shows that, the proposed method EMOTE outperformed the other methods in balancing the dataset. In addition to this it is also proved that, the classifier is able to effectively improve its performance on the dataset which is generated by EMOTE. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

The purpose of this study is to develop a classification framework for distinguishing the four most common neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobe degeneration, Dementia with Lewy bodies and vascular dementia, as well as patients with subjective memory complaints. Different biomarkers including features from images (volume features, region-wise grading features) and non-imaging features (CSF measures) were extracted for each subject. In clinical practice, the prevalence of different dementia types is imbalanced, posing challenges for learning an effective classification model. Therefore, we propose the use of the RUSBoost algorithm in order to train classifiers and to handle the class imbalance training problem. Furthermore, a multi-class feature selection method based on sparsity is integrated into the proposed framework to improve the classification performance. It also provides a way for investigating the importance of different features and regions. Using a dataset of 500 subjects, the proposed framework achieved a high accuracy of 75.2% with a balanced accuracy of 69.3% for the five-class classification using ten-fold cross validation, which is significantly better than the results using support vector machine or random forest, demonstrating the feasibility of the proposed framework to support clinical decision making. © 2017 The Authors","Dementia; Differential diagnosis; Imbalance learning; MRI; Multi-class feature selection; Neurodegenerative diseases","Elsevier Inc."

In these scenarios, one or some of the classes in the problem have a significantly lower a priori probability, usually leading to trivial or non-desirable classifiers. Because of this, imbalanced learning has been researched to a great extent by means of different approaches. Recently, the focus has switched from binary classification to other paradigms where imbalanced data also arise, such as ordinal classification. This paper tests the application of learning pairwise ranking with multiple granularity levels in an ordinal and imbalanced classification problem where the aim is to construct an accurate model for donor-recipient allocation in liver transplantation.

Although there are numerous solutions proposed, it is still unclear how to deal with all of these issues together and correctly evaluate the class distribution to select a proper treatment (especially considering the real-world applications where levels of uncertainty are eminently high).

One way to manage and assure product quality is to use machine learning algorithms based on relationship among various process steps. The purpose of this paper is to integrate manufacturing, inspection and after-sales service data to make full use of machine learning algorithms for estimating the products' quality in a supervised fashion. Proposed frameworks and methods are applied to actual data associated with heavy machinery engines. Design/methodology/approach - By following Lenzerini's formula, manufacturing, inspection and aftersales service data from various sources are integrated. The after-sales service data are used to label each engine as normal or abnormal. In this study, one-class classification algorithms are used due to class imbalance problem. To address multi-dimensionality of time series data, the symbolic aggregate approximation algorithm is used for data segmentation. Then, binary genetic algorithm-based wrapper approach is applied to segmented data to find the optimal feature subset. Findings - By employing machine learning-based anomaly detection models, an anomaly score for each engine is calculated. Experimental results show that the proposed method can detect defective engines with a high probability before they are shipped. Originality/value - Through data integration, the actual customer-perceived quality from after-sales service is linked to data from manufacturing and inspection process. In terms of business application, data integration and machine learning-based anomaly detection can help manufacturers establish quality management policies that reflect the actual customer-perceived quality by predicting defective engines.","After-sales service; Anomaly detection; Data integration; Heavy machinery engine; Machine learning; Manufacturing process","Emerald Group Publishing Ltd."

In recent years, many machine-learning methods have been developed for MA detection. Generally, MA candidates are first identified and then a set of features for these candidates are extracted. Finally, machine-learning methods are applied for candidate classification. In this paper, we present a novel unsupervised classification method based on sparse posterior cerebral artery (PCA) for MA detection. Since it does not have to consider a non-MA training set, the class imbalance problem can be avoided. Furthermore, effective features can be selected due to the characteristic of sparse PCA, which combines the elastic net penalty with the PCA. Meanwhile, a single T2 statistic is introduced, and the control limit can be determined for distinguishing true MAs from spurious candidates automatically.

Label powerset (LP) method reduces the multi-label classification problem to a single-label multi-class classification problem by treating each distinct combination of labels. However, the predictive performance of LP is challenged with imbalanced distribution among the labelsets, deteriorating the performance of traditional classifiers. In this paper, we study the problem of multi-label imbalanced data classification and propose a novel solution, called CSRankSVM (Cost sensitive Ranking Support Vector Machine), which assigns a different mis-classification cost for each labelset to effectively tackle the problem of imbalance for Multi-label data.

Direct learning from imbalanced dataset may pose unsatisfying results overfocusing on the accuracy of identification and deriving a suboptimal model. Various methodologies have been developed in tackling this problem including sampling, cost-sensitive, and other hybrid ones. However, the samples near the decision boundary which contain more discriminative information should be valued and the skew of the boundary would be corrected by constructing synthetic samples. Inspired by the truth and sense of geometry, we designed a new synthetic minority oversampling technique to incorporate the borderline information. What is more, ensemble model always tends to capture more complicated and robust decision boundary in practice. Taking these factors into considerations, a novel ensemble method, called Bagging of Extrapolation Borderline-SMOTE SVM (BEBS), has been proposed in dealing with imbalanced data learning (IDL) problems. Experiments on open access datasets showed significant superior performance using our model and a persuasive and intuitive explanation behind the method was illustrated.

With an aging population and ever-growing demand for medical care, effective management of patients' transitions among different care facilities will prove indispensible for shortening the length of hospital stays, improving patient outcomes, allocating critical care resources, and reducing preventable re-admissions. In this paper, we focus on an important problem of predicting the so-called 'patient flow' from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), which has not been explored via existing machine learning techniques. By treating a sequence of transition events as a point process, we develop a novel framework for modeling patient flow through various CUs and jointly predicting patients' destination CUs and duration days. Instead of learning a generative point process model via maximum likelihood estimation, we propose a novel discriminative learning algorithm aiming at improving the prediction of transition events in the case of sparse data. By parameterizing the proposed model as a mutually-correcting process, we formulate the estimation problem via generalized linear models, which lends itself to efficient learning based on alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Furthermore, we achieve simultaneous feature selection and learning by adding a group-lasso regularizer to the ADMM algorithm. Additionally, for suppressing the negative influence of data imbalance on the learning of model, we synthesize auxiliary training data for the classes with extremely few samples, and improve the robustness of our learning method accordingly. Testing on real-world data, we show that our method obtains superior performance in terms of accuracy of predicting the destination CU transition and duration of each CU occupancy. © 2016 IEEE.","discriminative learning; group lasso; imbalanced data; logistic regression; mutually-correcting process; Patient flow","IEEE Computer Society"

An automated screening system for DR can help in reduce the chances of complete blindness due to DR along with lowering the work load on ophthalmologists. Among the earliest signs of DR are microaneurysms (MAs). However, current schemes for MA detection appear to report many false positives because detection algorithms have high sensitivity. Inevitably some non-MAs structures are labeled as MAs in the initial MAs identification step. This is a typical “class imbalance problem”. Class imbalanced data has detrimental effects on the performance of conventional classifiers. In this work, we propose an ensemble based adaptive over-sampling algorithm for overcoming the class imbalance problem in the false positive reduction, and we use Boosting, Bagging, Random subspace as the ensemble framework to improve microaneurysm detection. The ensemble based over-sampling methods we proposed combine the strength of adaptive over-sampling and ensemble. The objective of the amalgamation of ensemble and adaptive over-sampling is to reduce the induction biases introduced from imbalanced data and to enhance the generalization classification performance of extreme learning machines (ELM).

Among numerous machine learning algorithms, Weighted Extreme Learning Machine (WELM) is one of the famous cases recently. It not only has Extreme Learning Machine (ELM)'s extremely fast training speed and better generalization performance than traditional Neuron Network (NN), but also has the merit in handling imbalance data by assigning more weight to minority class and less weight to majority class. But it still has the limitation of its weight generated according to class distribution of training data, thereby, creating dependency on input data [R. Sharma and A. S.

This leads to the lack of finding optimal weight at which good generalization performance could be achieved [R. Sharma and A. S.

To solve it, a hybrid algorithm which composed by WELM algorithm and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is proposed. Firstly, it distributes the weight according to the number of different samples, determines weighted method; Then, it combines the ELM model and the weighted method to establish WELM model; finally it utilizes PSO to optimize WELM's three parameters (input weight, bias, the weight of imbalanced training data).

As users have a tendency to provide positive feedbacks much more than the negative ones, the system that does not use methods to deal with class imbalance provides poor prediction of the contents that the user does not like to watch. Thus undesirable contents can often be recommended, which is perceived by users as bad recommendation. The probability of bad recommendations can be significantly decreased if the information about class imbalance is incorporated into the machine learning algorithm. However, this improvement comes at expense of degraded prediction of contents that user likes to watch; thus the quality of recommendations is decreased. In addition to learning algorithm, the choice of performance metric that is maximized influences user perception of the system performance. In this paper, it is shown that using the adjusted G-mean instead of G-mean metric can increase the quality of recommendations provided by the system based on neural network, without significant increase in the probability of bad recommendations. This further results in the increase of the recommendation diversity and, consequently, in the increase of user satisfaction. © 2016 IEEE.","class imbalance; Digital TV; neural networks; performance metrics; recommender systems","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

It also allows us to explicitly reduce the underrepresented class, which the most common preprocessing solutions handling class imbalance usually protect. As part of the experimental study, we show that the proposed prototype reduction method outperforms state-of-the-art preprocessing techniques. The preprocessing step yields multiple prototype sets that are later used in an ensemble, performing a weighted voting scheme with the nearest neighbor classifier.

The machine learning (ML) approach to human activity recognition can broadly be classified into two categories: training an ML model on (i) an impersonal dataset or (ii) a personal dataset. Previous research shows that models learned from personal datasets can provide better activity recognition accuracy compared to models trained on impersonal datasets. In this paper, we develop a hybrid incremental (HI) method with logistic regression models. This method uses incremental learning of logistic regression to combine the advantages of the impersonal and personal approaches. We investigate two essential issues for this method, which are the selection of the learning rate schedule and the class imbalance problem. Our experiments show that the models learned using our HI method give better accuracy than the models learned from personal or impersonal data only. Besides, the techniques of adaptive learning rate and cost-sensitive learning generally give faster updates and more robust ML models in incremental learning. Our method also has potential benefits in the area of privacy preservation.

These groups of proteins share very low sequence and structural similarities among them, which consequently hamper their annotation using sequence similarity-based search methods. Alternatively the machine learning-based methods can become a suitable choice, but the optimal performance through machine learning-based methods is being affected by various factors such as class imbalance, incomplete learning, selection of inappropriate features, etc. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach to deal with the class imbalance problem by finding the optimal class distribution for enhancing the prediction accuracy for the RNA silencing suppressors. The optimal class distribution was obtained using different resampling techniques with varying degrees of class distribution starting from natural distribution to ideal distribution, i.e., equal distribution. The experimental results support the fact that optimal class distribution plays an important role to achieve near perfect learning. The best prediction results are obtained with Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) learning algorithm. We could achieve a sensitivity of 98.5 %, specificity of 92.6 % with an overall accuracy of 95.3 % on a tenfold cross validation and is further validated using leave one out cross validation test. It was also observed that the machine learning models trained on oversampled training sets using synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) have relatively performed better than on both randomly undersampled and imbalanced training data sets. Further, we have characterized the important discriminatory sequence features of RNA-silencing suppressors which distinguish these groups of proteins from other protein families. © 2016, The Author(s).","Balanced training set; Class imbalance problem; Optimal class distribution; Random undersampling; Relieff; RNA silencing; SMOTE; SVM","Springer Verlag"

It is well known that rules are interesting way for representing data in a human interpretable way. The proposed rule-based classifier combines the random subspace and boosting approaches with ensemble of decision trees to construct a set of classification rules without involving global optimisation. The classifier considers random subspace approach to avoid overfitting, boosting approach for classifying noisy instances and ensemble of decision trees to deal with class-imbalance problem. The classifier uses two popular classification techniques: decision tree and k-nearest-neighbor algorithms. Decision trees are used for evolving classification rules from the training data, while k-nearest-neighbor is used for analysing the misclassified instances and removing vagueness between the contradictory rules. It considers a series of k iterations to develop a set of classification rules from the training data and pays more attention to the misclassified instances in the next iteration by giving it a boosting flavour. This paper particularly focuses to come up with an optimal ensemble classifier that will help for improving the prediction accuracy of DNA variant identification and classification task. The performance of proposed classifier is tested with compared to well-approved existing machine learning and data mining algorithms on genomic data (148 Exome data sets) of Brugada syndrome and 10 real benchmark life sciences data sets from the UCI (University of California, Irvine) machine learning repository. The experimental results indicate that the proposed classifier has exemplary classification accuracy on different types of biological data.

Software historical defect data has a complicated structure and a marked characteristic of class-imbalance; how to fully analyze and utilize the existing historical defect data and build more precise and effective classifiers has attracted considerable researchers’ interest from both academia and industry. Multiple kernel learning and ensemble learning are effective techniques in the field of machine learning. Multiple kernel learning can map the historical defect data to a higher-dimensional feature space and make them express better, and ensemble learning can use a series of weak classifiers to reduce the bias generated by the majority class and obtain better predictive performance. In this paper, we propose to use the multiple kernel learning to predict software defect. By using the characteristics of the metrics mined from the open source software, we get a multiple kernel classifier through ensemble learning method, which has the advantages of both multiple kernel learning and ensemble learning. We thus propose a multiple kernel ensemble learning (MKEL) approach for software defect classification and prediction. Considering the cost of risk in software defect prediction, we design a new sample weight vector updating strategy to reduce the cost of risk caused by misclassifying defective modules as non-defective ones.

Starting as a problem of skewed distributions of binary tasks, this topic evolved way beyond this conception.

This paper aims at discussing open issues and challenges that need to be addressed to further develop the field of imbalanced learning. Seven vital areas of research in this topic are identified, covering the full spectrum of learning from imbalanced data: classification, regression, clustering, data streams, big data analytics and applications, e.g., in social media and computer vision.

Machine learning algorithms apply flow statistics in traffic classification, which are significant for identifying both encrypted and private traffic. However, the discriminator bias problem and the class imbalance problem are two main challenges in traffic classification. The discriminator bias problem denotes that some flow statistics can improve the accuracies for some applications but reduce the accuracies for other applications. The class imbalance problem denotes that machine learning based traffic classifier identifies the minority application with a low accuracy. To address the above two issues, traffic classification framework based on ensemble clustering (TCFEC) is proposed in this paper. TCFEC is composed of several base classifiers trained by clustering in different feature subspaces and an optimal decision component. It is able to improve accuracy in traffic classification.

In real-world applications, there are advantages to extrapolating data from one user session to another. However, these advantages are limited if the data arise from different hardware systems, which often vary between application spaces. Currently, this creates a need to recalibrate classifiers, which negatively affects people's interest in using such systems. In this paper, we employ active weighted adaptation regularization (AwAR), which integrates weighted adaptation regularization (wAR) and active learning, to expedite the calibration process. wAR makes use of labeled data from the previous headset and handles class-imbalance, and active learning selects the most informative samples from the new headset to label. Experiments on single-trial event-related potential classification show that AwAR can significantly increase the classification accuracy, given the same number of labeled samples from the new headset. In other words, AwAR can effectively reduce the number of labeled samples required from the new headset, given a desired classification accuracy, suggesting value in collating data for use in wide scale transfer-learning applications. © 2001-2011 IEEE.","Active learning; active transfer learning; active weighted adaptation regularization; domain adaptation; electroencephalography (EEG); event-related potential; single-trial classification; transfer learning; visual evoked potential; weighted adaptation regularization","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Under-sampling is a widely used method in dealing imbalanced data set and its main idea is choosing a subset of majority class to make the data set balanced. However, some useful majority class information may be lost. In order to solve the problem, an under-sampling method based on sample weight for imbalance problem is proposed, named as KAcBag (K-means AdaCost bagging). In this method, sample weight is introduced to reveal the area where the sample is located. Firstly, according to the sample scale, a weight is made for each sample and is modified after clustering the data set. The samples which have less weight in the center of majority class. Then some samples are drawn from majority class in accordance with the sample weight. In the procedure, the samples in the center of majority class can be selected easily. The sampled majority class samples and all the minority class samples are combined as the training data set for a component classifier. After that, we can get several decision tree sub-classifiers. Finally, the prediction model is constructed based on the accuracy of each sub-classifiers. Experimental tests on nineteen UCI data sets and telecom user data show that KAcBag can make the selected samples have more representativeness. Based on that, this method can improve the the classification performance of minority class and reduce the scale of the problem. © 2016, Science Press.

Class imbalance refers to skews in class distribution in which normal wafer samples are considerably more abundant than fault samples. In such a situation, standard machine learning algorithms create FD models with classification boundaries that are biased toward majority-class data, resulting in high type II error rates. In this paper, we compare the performance of machine learning algorithms for class-imbalanced FD problems. We evaluate the performance of three sampling-based algorithms, four ensemble algorithms, four instance-based algorithms, and two support vector machine algorithms. Two experiments were conducted to compare algorithm performance using etching process data and chemical vapor deposition process data.

However, some machine learning methods are likely to give poor performance with imbalanced data between classes since they assume equal costs for each class intrinsically. To deal with this problem, existing researches only focus on sampling based approaches and lack of studies about cost-sensitive based approaches. This paper proposes cost-sensitive Deep Belief Networks for such imbalanced classification problems. The proposed approach is extended to multi-class scenario. Unequalized misclassification costs between classes have been applied to DBN.

As standard classifiers will be biased towards the majority class there exist a need for specific methods than can overcome this single-class dominance. Most of works concentrated on binary problems, where majority and minority class can be distinguished. But a more challenging problem arises when imbalance is present within multi-class datasets, as relations between classes tend to complicate. One class can be a minority class for some, while a majority for others. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for handling such scenarios, that combines the problem decomposition with cost-sensitive learning. According to divide-and-conquer rule, we decompose our multi-class data into a number of binary subproblems using one-versus-one approach. To each simplified task we delegate a cost-sensitive neural network with moving threshold. It relies on scaling the output of the classifier with a given cost function. This way, we adjust our support functions towards the minority class. We propose a novel method for automatically determining the cost, based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. This way we can estimate the cost matrix for each class pair independently. Then using a dedicated classifier fusion approach, we reconstruct the original multi-class problem. Experimental analysis backed-up with statistical testing clearly proves that such an approach is superior to state-of-the art ad-hoc and decomposition methods used in the literature. © 2016 IEEE.","Cost-sensitive; Decision templates; Imbalanced classification; Machine learning; Multi-class imbalance; Neural networks","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Early detection is crucial for ensuring five-year survival (which varies between 15% and 99% depending on the melanoma stage). Melanoma severity is typically diagnosed by invasive methods (e.g. a biopsy). In this paper, we propose an alternative system combining image analysis and machine learning for detecting melanoma presence and severity. The 86 features selected consider the shape, colour, pigment network and texture of the melanoma. As opposed to previous studies that have focused on distinguishing melanoma and non-melanoma images, our work considers a finer-grain classification problem using five categories: benign lesions and 4 different stages of melanoma. The dataset presents two main characteristics that are approached by specific machine learning methods: 1) the classes representing melanoma severity follow a natural order, and 2) the dataset is imbalanced, where benign lesions clearly outnumber melanoma ones. Different nominal and ordinal classifiers are considered, one of them being based on an ordinal cascade decomposition method. The cascade method is shown to obtain good performance for all classes, while respecting and exploiting the order information. Moreover, we explore the alternative of applying a class balancing technique, presenting good synergy with the ordinal and nominal methods. © 2016 IEEE.","Computer vision; Imbalanced classification; Machine learning; Melanoma; Ordinal classification","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, in many real-life situations the distribution of examples is skewed since the examples of some of the classes appear much more frequently. This poses a difficulty to learning algorithms, as they will be biased towards the majority classes. In recent years many solutions have been proposed to tackle imbalanced classification, yet they mainly concentrate on binary scenarios. Multi-class imbalanced problems are far more difficult as the relationships between the classes are no longer straightforward. Additionally, one should analyze not only the imbalance ratio but also the characteristics of the objects within each class. In this paper we present a study on oversampling for multi-class imbalanced datasets that focuses on the analysis of the class characteristics. We detect subsets of specific examples in each class and fix the oversampling for each of them independently. Thus, we are able to use information about the class structure and boost the more difficult and important objects.

Researchers have given considerable attention to the applications in many real-world scenarios. Although several works have utilized the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to select potentially optimal classifiers in imbalanced classifications, limited studies have been devoted to finding the classification threshold for testing or unknown datasets. In general, the classification threshold is simply set to 0.5, which is usually unsuitable for an imbalanced classification. In this study, we analyze the drawbacks of using ROC as the sole measure of imbalance in data classification problems. In addition, a novel framework for finding the best classification threshold is proposed. Experiments with SCOP v.1.53 data reveal that, with the default threshold set to 0.5, our proposed framework demonstrated a 20.63% improvement in terms of F-score compared with that of more commonly used methods. The findings suggest that the proposed framework is both effective and efficient.

It occurs when the number of instances in the majority class is significantly more than the number of instances in the minority class. This is a common problem which is recurring in most datasets, including the one used in this paper (i.e. direct marketing dataset). In direct marketing, businesses are interested in identifying potential buyers, or charities wish to identify potential givers. Several solutions have been suggested in the literature to address this problem, amongst which are data-level techniques, algorithmic-level techniques and a combination of both. In this paper, a model is proposed to solve imbalanced data using a Hybrid of Data-level and Algorithmic-level solutions (HybridDA), which involves oversampling the minority class, undersampling the majority class, and additionally, optimising the cost parameter, the gamma and the kernel type of Support Vector Machines (SVM) using a grid search.

However, the raw diagram is often perplexing because there are too many classes in it. Condensing the reverse engineered class diagram into a compact class diagram which contains only the important classes would enhance the understandability of the corresponding project. A number of recent works have proposed several supervised machine learning solutions that can be used for condensing reverse engineered class diagrams given a set of classes that are manually labeled as important or not. However, a challenge impacts the practicality of the proposed solutions, which is the expensive cost for manual labeling of training samples. More training samples will lead to better performance, but means higher manual labeling cost. Too much manual labeling will make the problem pointless since the aim is to automatically identify important classes. In this paper, to bridge this research gap, we propose a novel approach MCCondenser which only requires a small amount of training data but can still achieve a reasonably good performance. MCCondenser firstly selects a small proportion of all data, which are the most representative, as training data in an unsupervised way using k-means clustering. Next, it uses ensemble learning to handle the class imbalance problem so that a suitable classifier can be constructed based on the limited training data. To evaluate the performance of MCCondenser, we use datasets from nine open source projects, i.e., ArgoUML, JavaClient, JGAP, JPMC, Mars, Maze, Neuroph, Wro4J and xUML, containing a total of 2640 classes. We compare MCCondenser with two baseline approaches proposed by Thung et al., both of which are state-of-the-art approaches aimed to reduce the manual labeling cost. The experimental results show that MCCondenser can achieve an average AUC score of 0.73, which improves those of the two baselines by nearly 20% and 10% respectively. © 2016 IEEE.","Class Diagram; Cost Saving; Ensemble Learning; Manual Labeling; Unsupervised Learning","IEEE Computer Society"

Machine learning and computer-aided diagnosis have gained increasing attention in the medical field especially for early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Several techniques achieved promising prediction accuracies, however they were evaluated on pathologically unproven data sets from diverse imaging modalities making it hard to make a rational comparison among them. Moreover, many other factors such as pre-processing, important attributes for feature selection, class imbalance, missing values in the data and the imaging quality, distinctively affect the assessment of the prediction accuracy. To overcome these limitations, our proposed model is based on data preprocessing and important features selection to eliminate the class imbalance and redundant attributes while retaining most relevant features. In particular, incremental classifiers were used instead of traditional batch learner, so to enable early diagnosis without waiting for the full training dataset to be available. Incremental classifiers are suitable for real-time diagnostic system.

In an imbalanced dataset, there are significantly fewer training instances of one class compared to another class. Hence, the minority class instances are much more likely to be misclassified. In the literature, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) has been developed to deal with the classification of imbalanced datasets. It synthesizes new samples of the minority class to balance the dataset, by re-sampling the instances of the minority class. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms-based SMOTE uses the same sampling rate for all instances of the minority class. This results in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel genetic algorithm-based SMOTE (GASMOTE) algorithm. The GASMOTE algorithm uses different sampling rates for different minority class instances and finds the combination of optimal sampling rates. The experimental results on ten typical imbalance datasets show that, compared with SMOTE algorithm, GASMOTE can increase 5.9% on F-measure value and 1.6% on G-mean value, and compared with Borderline-SMOTE algorithm, GASMOTE can increase 3.7% on F-measure value and 2.3% on G-mean value. GASMOTE can be used as a new over-sampling technique to deal with imbalance dataset classification problem. We have particularly applied the GASMOTE algorithm to a practical engineering application: prediction of rockburst in the VCR rockburst datasets. The experiment results indicate that the GASMOTE algorithm can accurately predict the rockburst occurrence and hence provides guidance to the design and construction of safe deep mining engineering structures. © 2016, King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals.","Classification; Genetic algorithm; Imbalanced dataset; Rockburst; Sampling rate; SMOTE","Springer Verlag"

Conventional data level methods are employed as the preprocessing approaches to balance the datasets before the classifier learning. Since the balanced data remains unchanged during the learning process, one pre-deleted sample would never be used to train the classifier, which may result in information loss. To solve this problem, this work presents an One-sided Dynamic Undersampling (ODU) technique which adopts all samples in the training process, and dynamically determines whether a majority sample should be used for the classifier learning. Thus, ODU can dynamically undersample the majority class to balance the dataset. To validate the effectiveness of ODU, we integrate it into No-Propagation neural networks to propose an ODU No-Propagation Neural Networks (ODUNPNN). ODUNPNN takes all training samples into consideration, and dynamically undersamples majority class after each iteration, i.e. ODUNPNN integrates undersampling approach into the classifier learning process. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world imbalance datasets demonstrate that ODUNPNN outperforms the NPNN-based algorithms, and results in comparative performance compared with LASVM-AL, EasyEnsemble, and DyS on real-world imbalance datasets. The contributions of this paper are: (1) ODUNPNN integrates undersampling approach into the classifier learning process. (2) ODUNPNN dynamically balances training data in each iteration.

Experts measure hyperemia using levels in a grading scale, a procedure that is subjective, non-repeatable and time consuming, thus creating a need for its automatisation. However, the task is far from straightforward due to data issues such as class imbalance or correlated features. In this paper, we study the specific features of hyperemia and propose various approaches to address these problems in the context of an automatic framework for hyperemia grading. Methodology Oversampling, undersampling and SMOTE approaches were applied in order to tackle the problem of class imbalance. 25 features were computed for each image and regression methods were then used to transform them into a value on the grading scale. The values and relationships among features and experts’ values were analysed, and five feature selection techniques were subsequently studied. Results The lowest mean square error (MSE) for the regression systems trained with individual features is below 0.1 for both scales. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) obtains the best values, but is less consistent than the random forest (RF) method. When all features are combined, the best results for both scales are achieved with MLP. Correlation based feature selection (CFS) and M5 provide the best results, MSE = 0.108 and MSE = 0.061 respectively. Finally, the class imbalance problem is minimised with the SMOTE approach for both scales (MSE < 0.006). Conclusions Machine learning methods are able to perform an objective assessment of hyperemia grading, removing both intra- and inter-expert subjectivity while providing a gain in computation time. SMOTE and oversampling approaches minimise the class imbalance problem, while feature selection reduces the number of features from 25 to 3–5 without worsening the MSE. As the differences between the system and a human expert are similar to the differences between experts, we can therefore conclude that the system behaves like an expert. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Correlation-based feature selection; Hyperemia grading; Image processing; M5; Multi-layer perceptron; Oversampling; Radial basis function network; Random forests; Relief; SMOReg; SMOTE; Undersampling","Elsevier B.V."

We also show on a recent dataset that the algorithm is useful for the buyer prediction problem in large-scale recommender systems. © 2016 IEEE.","Classifier ensembles; Data stream learning; Recommender systems","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

However, SVM may not effectively detect the instance of the minority class and obtain a lower classification performance in the overlap region when learning from complicated data sets. Complicated data sets with imbalanced and overlapping class distributions are common in most practical applications. Moreover, they negatively affect the classification performances of the SVM. The present study proposes the use of modified slack variables within the SVM (MS-SVM) to solve complex data problems, including class imbalance and overlapping.

However, the parameters optimization of LLE-SVM model is computationally expensive by using the grid search algorithm, resulting in a lower efficiency of the model; and it ignores the imbalance of data sets when using SVM classier to differentiate the defective class and non-defective class. Thus resulting in a lower prediction accuracy. To solve these problems in LLE-SVM model, we propose a new software defect prediction model based on the improved Locally Linear Embedding and Support Vector Machines (ILLE-SVM). ILLE-SVM model employed the coarse-To-fine grid search algorithm to search the optimal parameters. It ensured a high accuracy of the parameters and reduced the parameters optimizing time by gradually narrowing the search scope and enlarging the parameters step. As for the question that SVM suffers a performance bias in classification when data sets are unbalanced, we employed gird search algorithm to automatically set the reasonable weights of different class. The comparison between LLE-SVM model and ILLE-SVM model is experimentally verified on four NASA defect data sets.

There exists a severe class imbalance phenomenon in predicting PPI sites, which leads to a decrease in overall performance for traditional statistical machine-learning-based classifiers, such as SVM and random forests. In this study, an ensemble of SVM and sample-weighted random forests (SSWRF) was proposed to deal with class imbalance. An SVM classifier was trained and applied to estimate the weights of training samples. Then, the training samples with estimated weights were utilized to train a sample-weighted random forests (SWRF). In addition, a lower-dimensional feature representation method, which consists of evolutionary conservation, hydrophobic property, solvent accessibility features derived from a target residue and its neighbors, was developed to improve the discriminative capability for PPI sites prediction. The analysis of feature importance shows that the proposed feature representation method is an effective representation for predicting PPI sites. The proposed SSWRF achieved 22.4% and 35.1% in MCC and F-measure, respectively, on independent validation dataset Dtestset72, and achieved 15.2% and 36.5% in MCC and F-measure, respectively, on PDBtestset164. Computational comparisons between existing PPI sites predictors on benchmark datasets demonstrated that the proposed SSWRF is effective for PPI sites prediction and outperforms the state-of-the-art sequence-based method (i.e., LORIS) released most recently.

Relieving the severity of class imbalance has been demonstrated to be a promising route for enhancing the prediction performance of a statistical machine learning-based predictor under an imbalanced learning scenario. In this study, we propose a novel dynamic query-driven sample rescaling (DQD-SR) strategy for addressing class imbalance. Unlike the traditional sample rescaling technique, which often yields a fixed balanced dataset, the proposed DQD-SR dynamically generates a query-driven balanced dataset based on KNN algorithm. A prediction model trained on a traditional sample rescaling (T-SR)-derived balanced dataset will partially learn the global knowledge buried in the original dataset, whereas a prediction model trained on DQD-SR will reflect the query-specific local knowledge between a query sample and its correlated neighbors in the original dataset. Thus, we developed an ensemble scheme to integrate the T-SR-based model and the DQD-SR-based model to further improve the overall prediction performance. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, we performed stringent cross-validation and independent validation tests on benchmark datasets concerning protein-nucleotide binding residues prediction, which is a typical imbalanced learning problem in bioinformatics. Computer experimental results show that the proposed method achieves high prediction performance and outperforms existing sequence-based protein-nucleotide binding residues predictors.

Though the class imbalance problem exists as a universal phenomenon in human activity recognition, few researches mentioned this problem and solved it. In order to reduce the influence of the imbalance datasets problem, the mixed-kernel based weighted extreme learning machine (MK-WELM) has been proposed in this paper. Considering that the performance of extreme learning machine (ELM) is greatly influenced by the choice of kernel, the mixed kernel method is proposed for ELM. In order to deal with the imbalanced problem, the cost sensitive method is utilized. The main idea of the cost sensitive method is that the cost of minority class increases with the misclassification rate. Considering the cost sensitive function and the mixed kernel method, the MK-WELM is constructed.

Most conventional classifiers assume equally balanced classes. They do not work well when impostor samples vastly outnumber the samples of the genuine user class. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, called RABOC, which inherits the natural capabilities of one-class classification and Real AdaBoost algorithm to handle the class imbalance problem in biometric systems. Particularly, we develop a weak classifier, which consists of one-class classifiers and is trained using data from both classes. We then exploit Real AdaBoost to combine the multiple weak classifiers in order to improve their performance without causing overfitting. Unlike the conventional Real AdaBoost, the weak classifiers in the proposed schema are learned on the same data set, but with different parameter choices. This not only generates the diversity necessary to make RABOC work, but also reduces the number of user-specified parameters. Extensive experiments were carried out on the BioSecure DS2 and XM2VTS benchmark databases, which involve data with extremely imbalanced class distribution. They demonstrate that the proposed RABOC algorithm can achieve a relative performance improvement of 28%, 24%, and 22% as compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, specifically the sum of scores, likelihood ratio based score fusion, and Support Vector Machines. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Biometric authentication; Class imbalance problem; Classifier ensemble; One-class classification; Real AdaBoost","Elsevier B.V."

This paper proposes a new classification framework, termed binarization with boosting and oversampling (BBO), for efficiently solving multiclass classification problems. The new framework is devised based on the one-versus-all (OVA) binarization technique. Unlike most previous work, BBO employs boosting for solving the hard-to-learn instances and oversampling for handling the class-imbalance problem arising due to OVA binarization. These two features make BBO different from other existing works. Our new framework has been tested extensively on several multiclass supervised and semi-supervised classification problems using five different base classifiers, including neural networks, C4.5, k-nearest neighbor, repeated incremental pruning to produce error reduction, support vector machine, random forest, and learning with local and global consistency.

In addition, most existing feature extraction techniques are hindered from automation due to involving human supervision. Toward this end, we propose an underwater fish recognition framework that consists of a fully unsupervised feature learning technique and an error-resilient classifier. Object parts are initialized based on saliency and relaxation labeling to match object parts correctly. A non-rigid part model is then learned based on fitness, separation, and discrimination criteria. For the classifier, an unsupervised clustering approach generates a binary class hierarchy, where each node is a classifier. To exploit information from ambiguous images, the notion of partial classification is introduced to assign coarse labels by optimizing the benefit of indecision made by the classifier.

Many machine learning techniques exist that can improve the performance of classifiers trained to determine the sentiment or emotional polarity of a tweet, however, they are designed with different objectives and it is unclear which techniques are most beneficial. Additionally, these techniques may behave differently depending on quality of data issues, such as class imbalance, a common problem when using real world data. In an effort to determine which techniques are more important, we tested 12 techniques consisting of: eight feature selection techniques, bagging, boosting and data sampling with two post sampling class ratios. Using five base learners, we compare these techniques against each other and each base learners with no additional technique. We train and test each classifier on a balanced dataset and two imbalanced datasets with different class ratios. Additionally, we conduct statistical tests to determine if the differences observed between techniques are significant. Our results show that bagging and seven of the eight feature selection techniques significantly improve performance (compared to using no technique) on all three datasets, while boosting and data sampling are less beneficial for imbalanced tweet sentiment data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study comparing these three types of techniques on tweet sentiment data and the first to show that feature selection and ensemble techniques perform better than data sampling on tweet sentiment data. © 2015 IEEE.","Bagging; Boosting; Classification; Feature selection; Random undersampling; Sentiment analysis; Tweet mining","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Whilst existing methods, based on linear equations, are proficient at distinguishing between the two classes of anemia, they fail to identify the co-occurrence of this issues.

There are many methods of decomposing such a task into a set of smaller classification problems involving two classes only. Among the methods, pairwise coupling proposed by Hastie and Tibshirani (1998) is one of the best known. Its principle is to separate each pair of classes ignoring the remaining ones. Then all objects are tested against these classifiers and a voting scheme is applied using pairwise class probability estimates in a joint probability estimate for all classes. A closer look at the pairwise strategy shows the problem which impacts the final result. Each binary classifier votes for each object even if it does not belong to one of the two classes which it is trained on. This problem is addressed in our strategy. We propose to use additional classifiers to select the objects which will be considered by the pairwise classifiers. A similar solution was proposed by Moreira and Mayoraz (1998), but they use classifiers which are biased according to imbalance in the number of samples representing classes. © 2016 Wiesław Chmielnicki et al., published by De Gruyter Open 2016.","multi-class classification; pairwise coupling; problem decomposition; support vector machines","Walter de Gruyter GmbH"

We propose SG-ELM particularly for systems that are required to be stable during learning; i.e., the estimated model parameters remain bounded during learning. We use a Lyapunov approach to prove both asymptotic stability of estimation error and boundedness in the model parameters suitable for identification of nonlinear dynamic systems. Using the Lyapunov approach, we determine an upper bound for the learning rate of SG-ELM. The SG-ELM algorithm not only guarantees a stable learning but also reduces the computational demand compared to the recursive least squares based OS-ELM algorithm (Liang et al., 2006). In order to demonstrate the working of SG-ELM on a real-world problem, an advanced combustion engine identification is considered. The algorithm is applied to two case studies: An online regression learning for system identification of a Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) Engine and an online classification learning (with class imbalance) for identifying the dynamic operating envelope. The case studies demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed SG-ELM is comparable to that of the OS-ELM approach but adds stability and a reduction in computational effort. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Engine control; Extreme learning machine; Lyapunov stability; Online learning; Operating envelope; System identification","Elsevier B.V."

While algorithms which predict the binding of miRNAs to their targets are abundant, the same is not true for the association of miRNAs to targets which can be implicated in cancer. Machine learning approaches, which have been implemented in target prediction need to be extrapolated with proper feature selection to reach an acceptable level of accuracy in the prediction of associations of miRNAs to cancer. In this study we present a comparison of three different learning algorithms viz., the kernel-based Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree-based Random Forest (RF) and C4.5 to predict miRNAs associated with cancer. 60 informative features were extracted from a dataset of experimentally validated miRNA based on sequence, thermodynamics of miRNA-mRNA binding and their hybridization. Initially, features were ranked based on F-score and a two-stage Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) process was employed to select the optimal subset of features for individual classifier. Class imbalance in the training set was overcome by employing cost-sensitive approach. The performance of each individual learning algorithm was evaluated in terms of precision, recall, F-measure and AUC. Subsequently, the learning algorithm with better performance measure would be utilized for constructing a two-step binary classifier viz., miRSEQ and miRINT, which will identify a miRNA to be associated with the cancer pathway. Based on our comparative analysis, it was evident that the decision tree based RF model performed well in terms of better precision and AUC (for miRSEQ), but was moderate (for miRINT). © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.","AUC; Class imbalance; Cost-sensitive; RFE; Thermodynamics of miRNA-mRNA binding","Bentham Science Publishers B.V."

The use of defect predictors allows test engineers to focus on defective modules. Thereby testing resources can be allocated effectively and the quality assurance costs can be reduced. For within-project defect prediction (WPDP), there should be sufficient data within a company to train any prediction model. Without such local data, cross-project defect prediction (CPDP) is feasible since it uses data collected from similar projects in other companies. Software defect datasets have the class imbalance problem increasing the difficulty for the learner to predict defects. In addition, the impact of imbalanced data on the real performance of models can be hidden by the performance measures chosen. We investigate if the class imbalance learning can be beneficial for CPDP. In our approach, the asymmetric misclassification cost and the similarity weights obtained from distributional characteristics are closely associated to guide the appropriate resampling mechanism. We performed the effect size A-statistics test to evaluate the magnitude of the improvement. For the statistical significant test, we used Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Simple physicochemical molecular descriptors were utilized for data modeling. Support vector machine classifiers were constructed and compared using multiple comparison tests. Results showed that the models developed on the basis of resampling strategies displayed better performance than the cost-sensitive classification models, especially in the case of oversampling data where misclassification rates for minority class have values of 0.11 and 0.14 for training and test set, respectively.

Histotyping by pathologists has good reproducibility, but occasional cases are challenging and require immunohistochemistry and subspecialty consultation. Motivated by the need for more accurate and reproducible diagnoses and to facilitate pathologists' workflow, we propose an automatic framework for ovarian carcinoma classification. Materials and Methods: Our method is inspired by pathologists' workflow. We analyse imaged tissues at two magnification levels and extract clinically-inspired color, texture, and segmentation-based shape descriptors using image-processing methods. We propose a carefully designed machine learning technique composed of four modules: A dissimilarity matrix, dimensionality reduction, feature selection and a support vector machine classifier to separate the five ovarian carcinoma subtypes using the extracted features. Results: This paper presents the details of our implementation and its validation on a clinically derived dataset of eighty high-resolution histopathology images. The proposed system achieved a multiclass classification accuracy of 95.0% when classifying unseen tissues. Assessment of the classifier's confusion (confusion matrix) between the five different ovarian carcinoma subtypes agrees with clinician's confusion and reflects the difficulty in diagnosing endometrioid and serous carcinomas. Conclusions: Our results from this first study highlight the difficulty of ovarian carcinoma diagnosis which originate from the intrinsic class-imbalance observed among subtypes and suggest that the automatic analysis of ovarian carcinoma subtypes could be valuable to clinician's diagnostic procedure by providing a second opinion. © 2016 Journal of Pathology Informatics | Published by Wolters Kluwer -Medknow.","Computer-aided diagnosis; machine learning; ovarian carcinoma","Medknow Publications"

Specifically, the outputs of the minority classes in ELM are properly compensated. For a binary-class problem, the compensation can be regarded as a single variable optimization problem, thus the golden section search algorithm is adopted to find the optimal compensation value. For a multi-class problem, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve the multivariate optimization problem and to provide the optimal combination of compensations. Experimental results on lots of imbalanced data sets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm. Statistical results indicate that the proposed approach not only outperforms the original ELM, but also yields better or at least competitive results compared with several widely used and state-of-the-art class imbalance learning methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","Class imbalance learning; Decision outputs compensation; Extreme learning machine; Optimization; Prior data distributions","Elsevier B.V."

Although the Wi-Fi interface bestows commendable throughput and data transfer efficiency, it is least power efficient in the idle state and causes highest energy overhead when scanning for networks. In this paper we present a data driven approach to alleviate this issue, focusing on Wi-Fi usage by the user's perspective. We model the Wi-Fi usage of mobile users based on their past usage to predict usage requirements. This allows intelligently switching on the Wi-Fi interface only if the user context demands. Thus, it reduces long periods of time being in the idle state and significantly lessens the number of futile network scans. Based on the trace data collected from Rice-Livelab study, we extract temporal, application usage, operational state and location context data to build our prediction model. This study includes a systematic feature engineering process followed by the deployment of machine learning algorithms on the target dataset.

However, text classification is often hampered by the lack of adequate training data. This motivates the question: how can we train NB more effectively whentraining data is very scarce?In this paper, we introduce an established subsampling techniquefrom statistics - the jackknife - into machine learning. Our approachjackknifes documents themselves to create new ""pseudo-documents."" Theunderlying idea is that although these pseudo-documents do not havesemantic meaning, they are equally representative of the underlyingdistribution of terms. Therefore, they could be used to train any classifierthat learns this underlying distribution, namely, any parametric classifiersuch as NB (but not, for example, non-parametric classifiers such as SVMand k-NN). Furthermore, the marginal value of this additional trainingdata should be the highest precisely when the original data is inadequate. We then show that our jackknife technique is related to the questionof additively smoothing NB via an appropriately defined notion of""adjointness."" This relation is surprising since it connects a statisticaltechnique for handling scarce data to a question about the NB model. Accordingly, we are able to shed light on optimal values of the smoothingparameter for NB in the very scarce data regime. We validate our approach on a wide array of standard benchmarks - both binary and multi-class - for two event models of multinomial NB. Weshow that the jackknife technique can dramatically improve the accuracyfor both event models of NB in the regime of very scarce training data. Inparticular, our experiments show that the jackknife can make NB moreaccurate than SVM for binary problems in the very scarce training dataregime. We also provide a comprehensive characterization of the accuracyof these important classifiers (for both binary and multiclass) in the veryscarce data regime for benchmark text datasets, without feature selectionand class imbalance. © 2015 IEEE.","Comparison between Naive Bayes and SVM; Jackknife Subsampling; Multinomial Event Models; Naive Bayes; Scarce Data","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

PD monitoring is a promising approach that ensures the reliable performance of electrical assets through condition based maintenance. Machine learning techniques have been successfully used to discover features and specific patterns that can differentiate between partial discharges and noise. On-line PD monitoring systems have been recently deployed for continuously assessing the equipment health, so that its maintenance requires minimal cost and shorter disruption to operational services. However, labelled data is required in order to build predictive models for on-line PD monitoring. Labelled data is expensive to obtain since it requires expert input. In addition, in real scenarios the ratio of noise pulses to real PDs can be high, making the learning task harder. This paper investigates an active learning (AL) approach for streaming data that aims to maintain an on-line model that is robust to class imbalances. The empirical evaluation, using real HFCT sensor data, shows that the proposed AL approach is able to achieve over 80% accuracy in noisy scenarios with minimal expert dependence (only 2% of the labelled instances). © 2016 IEEE",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The automated detection and quantification of PA over time empowers lifestyle interventions, facilitating reliable exercise tracking and data-driven counseling. Methods: We propose and compare various combinations of machine learning (ML) schemes for the automatic classification of PA from multi-modal data, simultaneously captured by a biaxial accelerometer and a heart rate (HR) monitor. Intensity levels (low / moderate / vigorous) were recognized, as well as for vigorous exercise, its modality (sustained aerobic / resistance / mixed). In to - tal, 178.63 h of data about PA intensity (65.55 % low / 18.96 % moderate / 15.49 % vigorous) and 17.00 h about modality were collected in two experiments: one in freeliving conditions, another in a fitness center under controlled protocols. The structure used for automatic classification comprised: a) definition of 42 time-domain signal features, b) dimensionality reduction, c) data clustering, and d) temporal filtering to exploit time redundancy by means of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Four dimensionality reduction techniques and four clustering algorithms were studied. In order to cope with class imbalance in the dataset, a custom performance metric was defined to aggregate recognition accuracy, precision and recall. Results: The best scheme, which comprised a projection through Linear Discriminant Ana - lysis (LDA) and k-means clustering, was evaluated in leave-one-subject-out crossvalidation; notably outperforming the standard industry procedures for PA intensity classification: score 84.65 %, versus up to 63.60 %.

The traditional classification algorithms are often biased towards the majority class when learning from imbalanced data. Much work have been proposed to address this problem, including data re-sampling, algorithm modification, and cost-sensitive learning. However, most of them focus on one of these techniques. This paper proposes to utilize both algorithm modification and cost-sensitive learning based on decision-theoretic rough set (DTRS) model. In particular, we use naive Bayes classifier as the base classifier and modify it for imbalanced learning. For cost-sensitive learning, we adopt the systematic method from DTRS to derive required thresholds that have the minimum decision cost.

On such problems, the classifier becomes biased in favour of the majority class. This leads to inaccuracy on the important minority classes, such as specific diseases and gene functions. Synthetic oversampling mitigates this by balancing the training set, whilst avoiding the pitfalls of random under and oversampling. The existing methods are primarily based on the SMOTE algorithm, which employs a bias of randomly generating points between nearest neighbours. The relationship between the generative bias and the latent distribution has a significant impact on the performance of the induced classifier. Our research into gamma-ray spectra classification has shown that the generative bias applied by SMOTE is inappropriate for domains that conform to the manifold property, such as spectra, text, image and climate change classification.

Financial statement fraud detection (FSFD) based on machine learning is a very important problem for avoiding financial risk and maintaining an orderly market. The purpose of this research was to develop a multiple instance learning model that is capable of detecting and predicting the risk of fraudulent financial reporting. Methodology:. Each pair was composed of a singe-instance learning algorithm and its corresponding multiple instance learning algorithm, which were trained using a data set of 484 fraud companies as well as 902 normal companies with forming 4158 instances from Item 8 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Form 10-K. Findings:. Empirical study shows that MIBoost, miGraph and CKNN are superior compared to AdaBoostM1, SVM and KNN correspondingly in accuracy, F1 score and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), which prove that multiple instance learning algorithms can fit FSFD better, especially under class-imbalance and few training data. Originality:. When a detecting label which corresponds to temporally local Financial Statement is attached collectively to groups of Financial Statements for one company without presenting the data to which Financial Statement this label is assigned, it is a multiple instance problem. The research presents a multiple instance learning model for FSFD originally. Practical value:. We have also considered the fact that some auditors are dissatisfied with the single label learning algorithms because there are many instances in one company without label.

The class imbalance problem occurs when one class of data severely outnumbers the other classes of data. The classification models learned on Support Vector Machines (SVM) are quite prominent in exhibiting better generalization abilities even in the context of the class imbalance problem. However, it is proved that the high imbalance ratio hinders SVM learning performance.

Methods/Statistical Analysis: The Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE) wrapper feature selection is analyzed in this study and its performance on one document analysis and two biomedical unbalanced datasets is compared with two prominent feature selection methods like Chi-Square (CHI) test and Information Gain (IG) using Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classification models. Findings: From this empirical study two major identifications are reported: 1. For the considered scenarios, classification models learned on IG and CHI test are better performed than SVM-RFE feature selection of high class imbalance setting. 2. The SVM-RFE on rebalanced data yielded better performance than SVM-RFE on original data. Application/Improvements: Considered feature selection methods, including SVM-RFE yielded better performance on oversampled data than SVM-RFE on original data.

Although the class imbalance problem has recently attracted a great deal of attention, little effort has been undertaken to develop feature selection techniques. In addition, most applications involving feature selection focus on classification accuracy but not cost, although costs are important. To cope with imbalance problems, we developed a cost-sensitive feature selection algorithm that adds the cost-based evaluation function of a filter feature selection using a chaos genetic algorithm, referred to as CSFSG. The evaluation function considers both feature-acquiring costs (test costs) and misclassification costs in the field of network security, thereby weakening the influence of many instances from the majority of classes in large-scale datasets. The CSFSG algorithm reduces the total cost of feature selection and trades off both factors. The behavior of the CSFSG algorithm is tested on a large-scale dataset of network security, using two kinds of classifiers: C4.5 and k -nearest neighbor (KNN). The results of the experimental research show that the approach is efficient and able to effectively improve classification accuracy and to decrease classification time. In addition, the results of our method are more promising than the results of other cost-sensitive feature selection algorithms. © 2016 Jing Bian et al.",,"Hindawi Publishing Corporation"

It has been showed that the damage caused by Twitter spam can reach far beyond the social media platform itself. To mitigate the threat, a lot of recent studies use machine learning techniques to classify Twitter spam and report very satisfactory results. However, most of the studies overlook a fundamental issue that is widely seen in real-world Twitter data, i.e., the class imbalance problem. In this paper, we show that the unequal distribution between spam and non-spam classes in the data has a great impact on spam detection rate. To address the problem, we propose an ensemble learning approach, which involves three steps. In the first step, we adjust the class distribution in the imbalanced data set using various strategies, including random oversampling, random undersampling and fuzzy-based oversampling. In the next step, a classification model is built upon each of the redistributed data sets. In the final step, a majority voting scheme is introduced to combine all the classification models.

In this paper, a novel classification approach is proposed to solve the online data imbalance problem by integrating a fast and efficient learning algorithm, that is, Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), and a typical sampling strategy, that is, the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). To reduce the severe imbalance, the granulation division for major-class samples is made according to the samples' distribution characteristic, and the original samples are replaced by the obtained granule core to prepare a balanced sample set. In online stage, we firstly make granulation division for minor-class and then conduct oversampling using SMOTE in the region around granule core and granule border. Therefore, the training sample set is gradually balanced and the online ELM model is dynamically updated. We also theoretically introduce fuzzy information entropy to prove that the proposed approach has the lower bound of model reliability after undersampling.

This disease is a worldwide zoonosis of major public health concern and is considered a neglected disease by the World Health Organization. The complete genome of E. multilocularis has been recently sequenced and assembled in a collaborative effort between the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and our group, with the main aim of analyzing protein-coding genes. These analyses suggested that approximately 10% of E. multilocularis genome is composed of protein-coding regions. This shows there is still a vast proportion of the genome that needs to be explored, including non-coding RNAs such as small RNAs (sRNAs). Within this class of small regulatory RNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) can be found, which have been identified in many different organisms ranging from viruses to higher eukaryotes. MiRNAs are a key regulation mechanism of gene expression at post-transcriptional level and play important roles in biological processes such as development, proliferation, cell differentiation and metabolism in animals and plants. In spite of this, identification of miRNAs directly from genome-wide data only is still a very challenging task. There are many miRNAs that remain unidentified due to the lack of either sequence information of particular phylums or appropriate algorithms to identify novel miRNAs. The motivation for this work is the discovery of new miRNAs in E. multilocularis based on non-target genomic data only, in order to obtain useful information from the currently available unexplored data. In this work, we present the discovery of new pre-miRNAs in the E. multilocularis genome through a novel approach based on machine learning. We have extracted the most commonly used structural features from the folded sequences of the parasite genome: triplets, minimum free energy and sequence length. These features have been used to train a novel deep architecture of self-organizing maps (SOMs). This model can be trained with a high class imbalance and without the artificial definition of a negative class. We discovered 886 pre-miRNA candidates within the E. multilocularis genome-wide data. After that, experimental validation by small RNA-seq analysis clearly showed 23 pre-miRNA candidates with a pattern compatible with miRNA biogenesis, indicating them as high confidence miRNAs. We discovered new pre-miRNA candidates in E. multilocularis using non-target genomic data only. Predictions were meaningful using only sequence data, with no need of RNA-seq data or target analysis for prediction. Furthermore, the methodology employed can be easily adapted and applied on any draft genomes, which are actually the most interesting ones since most non-model organisms have this kind of status and carry real biological and sanitary relevance. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"Academic Press Inc."

In this scenario, classifiers tend to yield poor accuracy on the minority class despite realizing high overall accuracy. This is due to the influence of the majority class on traditional training criteria. In this paper, we aim to apply genetic programming to address this issue by adapting existing fitness functions. We examine two fitness functions from previous studies and develop two new fitness functions to evolve GP classifiers with superior accuracy on the minority class and overall.

This problem basically refers to the skewness in the data underlying distribution which, in turn, imposes many difficulties on typical machine learning algorithms. To deal with the emerging issues arising from multi-class skewed distributions, existing efforts are mainly divided into two categories: model-oriented solutions and data-oriented techniques. Focusing on the latter, this paper presents a new over-sampling technique which is inspired by Mahalanobis distance. The presented over-sampling technique, called MDO (Mahalanobis Distance-based Over-sampling technique), generates synthetic samples which have the same Mahalanobis distance from the considered class mean as other minority class examples. By preserving the covariance structure of the minority class instances and intelligently generating synthetic samples along the probability contours, new minority class instances are modelled better for learning algorithms. Moreover, MDO can reduce the risk of overlapping between different class regions which are considered as a serious challenge in multi-class problems. Our theoretical analyses and empirical observations across wide spectrum multi-class imbalanced benchmarks indicate that MDO is the method of choice by offering statistical superior MAUC and precision compared to the popular over-sampling techniques. © 2015 IEEE.","Mahalanobis distance; Multi-class imbalance problems; over-sampling techniques","IEEE Computer Society"

As standard classifiers will be biased toward the majority class there exist a need for specific methods than can overcome this single-class dominance. Most of works concentrated on binary problems, where majority and minority class can be distinguished. But a more challenging problem arises when imbalance is present within multi-class datasets, as relations between classes tend to complicate. One class can be a minority class for some, while a majority for others. In this paper, we propose an efficient method for handling such scenarios that combines the problem decomposition with ensemble learning. According to divide-and-conquer rule, we decompose our multi-class data into a number of binary subproblems using one-versus-one approach. To each simplified task we delegate a ensemble of classifiers dedicated to binary imbalanced problems. Then using a dedicated classifier fusion approach, we reconstruct the original multi-class problem.

It is also used as a useful reagent for various analytical research methods ranging from cellular imaging to gene expression analysis. However, identification and annotation of bioluminescent proteins is a difficult task as they share poor sequence similarities among them. In this paper, we present a novel approach for within-class and between-class balancing as well as diversifying of a training dataset by effectively combining unsupervised K-Means algorithm with Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) in order to achieve the true performance of the prediction model. Further, we experimented by varying different levels of balancing ratio of positive data to negative data in the training dataset in order to probe for an optimal class distribution which produces the best prediction accuracy. The appropriately balanced and diversified training set resulted in near complete learning with greater generalization on the blind test datasets. The obtained results strongly justify the fact that optimal class distribution with a high degree of diversity is an essential factor to achieve near perfect learning. Using random forest as the weak learners in boosting and training it on the optimally balanced and diversified training dataset, we achieved an overall accuracy of 95.3% on a tenfold cross validation test, and an accuracy of 91.7%, sensitivity of 89. 3% and specificity of 91.8% on a holdout test set.

In these processes, components are inspected to ensure adherence to design specifications. Components that are determined to be out-of-specifications are rejected. The benefits of inspection are two-fold. First, defects can be removed early in the process, preventing higher costs incurred in detecting them downstream. Second, the inspection results provide information for manual troubleshooting of root-causes, potentially leading to an improvement in overall quality. However, this form of inspection may also incurs costs if there are false alarms associated with the automated inspection method.

In imbalanced distributions, a class or some classes of data, called minority class(es), is/are under-represented compared to other classes. This skewness in the data underlying distribution causes many difficulties for typical machine learning algorithms. The notion becomes even more complicated when machine learning algorithms are to combat multi-class imbalanced problems. The presented solutions for tackling the issues arising from imbalanced distributions, generally fall into two main categories: data-oriented methods and model-based algorithms. Focusing on the latter, this paper suggests an elegant blend of boosting and over-sampling paradigms, which is called MDOBoost, to bring considerable benefits to the learning ability of multi-class imbalanced data sets. The over-sampling technique introduced and adopted in this paper, Mahalanobis distance-based over-sampling technique (MDO in short), is delicately incorporated into boosting algorithm. In fact, the minority classes are over-sampled via MDO technique in such a way that they almost preserve the original minority class characteristics. MDO, in comparison with the popular method in this field, SMOTE, generates more similar minority class examples to original class samples. Moreover, the broader representation of minority class examples is provided via MDO, and this, in turn, causes the classifier to build larger decision regions. MDOBoost increases the generalization ability of a classifier, since it indicates better results with pruned version of C4.5 classifier; unlike other over-sampling/boosting procedures, which have difficulties with pruned version of C4.5. MDOBoost is applied to real-world multi-class imbalanced benchmarks and its performance is then compared with several data-level and model-based algorithms. The empirical results and theoretical analyses reveal that MDOBoost offers superior advantages compared to popular class decomposition and over-sampling techniques in terms of MAUC, G-mean, and minority class recall. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Boosting algorithm; Class decomposition techniques; Mahalanobis distance; Multi-class imbalance; Over-sampling","Springer Verlag"

To address this issue, this paper proposes a new approach, called class-oriented feature selection (COFS), to identify a relevant feature subset for every class. It combines the proposed local metric and the existing global metric to yield a potentially optimal feature subset for each class, and then removes the redundant features in each feature subset based on the weighted symmetric uncertainty. Additionally, to enhance the generalization on network traffic data, an ensemble learning based scheme is presented with COFS to overcome the negative impacts of the data drift on a traffic classifier.

However, the success of such a machine learning technique is inherently limited when applied to the problem of class imbalance learning as their structure is designed to generalize from sampled data sets. In this Paper, a new iterative fuzzy support vector machine algorithm (IFSVM) is proposed for severely imbalanced rail data classification with bootstrapping-based oversampling and undersampling. Data resampling techniques, oversampling and undersampling, are the best choice for overcoming the class imbalance problem. In this work, we succeeded in incorporating the unique learning mechanism of IFSVM and the class distribution advantages of resampling techniques. Experimental results on rail data set are effective not only on the overall generalization performance, but also on drastically reducing the algorithm's time complexity and the number of support vectors. Our comparison study shows that the influence of data under-sampling method is superior compared to the bootstrapping-based over-sampling as it enables the proposed Iterative Fuzzy Support Vector machine to include better generalization capabilities with computational effectiveness. © 2015 IEEE.","fuzzy support vector machines; imbalanced data; over-sampling; support vectro machines; under-sampling","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Quantification of these pathological markers on histological sections is widely performed to study the disease and to evaluate new therapies. However, segmentation of neuropathology images presents difficulties inherent to histology (presence of debris, tissue folding, non-specific staining) as well as specific challenges (sparse staining, irregular shape of the lesions). Here, we present a supervised classification approach for the robust pixel-level classification of large neuropathology whole slide images. We propose a weighted form of Random Forest in order to fit nonlinear decision boundaries that take into account class imbalance. Both color and texture descriptors were used as predictors and model selection was performed via a leave-one-image-out cross-validation scheme. Our method showed superior results compared to the current state of the art method when applied to the segmentation of Aβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in a human brain sample. Furthermore, using parallel computing, our approach easily scales-up to large gigabyte-sized images. To show this, we segmented a whole brain histology dataset of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. This demonstrates our method relevance as a routine tool for whole slide microscopy images analysis in clinical and preclinical research settings. © 2015 IEEE.",,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The primary epimutations identified involve altered differential DNA methylation regions (DMRs). Different environmental toxicants have been shown to promote exposure (i.e., toxicant) specific signatures of germline epimutations. Analysis of genomic features associated with these epimutations identified low-density CpG regions (<3 CpG / 100bp) termed CpG deserts and a number of unique DNA sequence motifs. The rat genome was annotated for these and additional relevant features. The objective of the current study was to use a machine learning computational approach to predict all potential epimutations in the genome. A number of previously identified sperm epimutations were used as training sets. A novel machine learning approach using a sequential combination of Active Learning and Imbalance Class Learner analysis was developed. The transgenerational sperm epimutation analysis identified approximately 50K individual sites with a 1 kb mean size and 3,233 regions that had a minimum of three adjacent sites with a mean size of 3.5 kb. A select number of the most relevant genomic features were identified with the low density CpG deserts being a critical genomic feature of the features selected. A similar independent analysis with transgenerational somatic cell epimutation training sets identified a smaller number of 1,503 regions of genome-wide predicted sites and differences in genomic feature contributions. The predicted genome-wide germline (sperm) epimutations were found to be distinct from the predicted somatic cell epimutations. Validation of the genome-wide germline predicted sites used two recently identified transgenerational sperm epimutation signature sets from the pesticides dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and methoxychlor (MXC) exposure lineage F3 generation. Analysis of this positive validation data set showed a 100% prediction accuracy for all the DDT-MXC sperm epimutations. Observations further elucidate the genomic features associated with transgenerational germline epimutations and identify a genome-wide set of potential epimutations that can be used to facilitate identification of epigenetic diagnostics for ancestral environmental exposures and disease susceptibility. © 2015 Haque et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"Public Library of Science"

Although several computational tools have been developed to identify primary miRNAs and precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), very few provide the functionality of locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. This manuscript introduces a novel algorithm for predicting miRNAs named miRLocator, which isbased on machine learning techniques and sequence and structural features extracted from miRNA:miRNA∗ duplexes. To address the class imbalance problem (few real miRNAs and a large number of pseudo miRNAs), the prediction models in miRLocator were optimized by considering critical (and often ignored) factors that can markedly affect the prediction accuracy of mature miRNAs, including the machine learning algorithm and the ratio between training positive and negative samples. Ten-fold cross-validation on 5854 experimentally validated miRNAs from 19 plant species showed that miRLocator performed better than the state-of-art miRNA predictor miRdup in locating mature miRNAs within plant pre-miRNAs. miRLocator will aid researchers interested in discovering miRNAs from model and non-model plant species. © 2015 Cui et al.

The first one corresponds to a problem of implementing interpretable models, e.g., classification rules or decision trees. The second issue represents a situation in which the number of examples from one class (e.g., healthy patients) is significantly higher than the number of examples from the other class (e.g., ill patients). Learning algorithms which are prone to the imbalance data return biased models towards the majority class. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic combination of soft rules, which can be seen as a probabilistic version of the classification rules, by introducing new latent random variable called conjunctive feature. The conjunctive features represent conjunctions of values of attribute variables (features) and we assume that for given conjunctive feature the object and its label (class) become independent random variables. In order to deal with the between class imbalance problem, we present a new estimator which incorporates the knowledge about data imbalanceness into hyperparameters of initial probability of objects with fixed class labels. Additionally, we propose a method for aggregating sufficient statistics needed to estimate probabilities in a graph-based structure to speed up computations. At the end, we carry out two experiments: (1) using benchmark datasets, (2) using medical datasets. The results are discussed and the conclusions are drawn. © 2015, The Author(s).","Classification rules; Imbalanced data; Medical diagnosis; Probabilistic combination","Kluwer Academic Publishers"

Class imbalance is ubiquitous in Machine Learning, Data Mining and Pattern Recognition applications; therefore, these research communities have responded to such interest with literally dozens of methods and techniques. Surprisingly, there are still many fundamental open-ended questions such as “Are all learning paradigms equally affected by class imbalance?”, “What is the expected performance loss for different imbalance degrees?” and “How much of the performance losses can be recovered by the treatment methods?”. In this paper, we propose a simple experimental design to assess the performance of class imbalance treatment methods. This experimental setup uses real data set with artificially modified class distributions to evaluate classifiers in a wide range of class imbalance. We apply such experimental design in a large-scale experimental evaluation with 22 data set and seven learning algorithms from different paradigms. We also propose a statistical procedure aimed to evaluate the relative degradation and recoveries, based on confidence intervals. This procedure allows a simple yet insightful visualization of the results, as well as provide the basis for drawing statistical conclusions. Our results indicate that the expected performance loss, as a percentage of the performance obtained with the balanced distribution, is quite modest (below 5 %) for the most balanced distributions up to 10 % of minority examples. However, the loss tends to increase quickly for higher degrees of class imbalance, reaching 20 % for 1 % of minority class examples. Support Vector Machine is the classifier paradigm that is less affected by class imbalance, being almost insensitive to all but the most imbalanced distributions. Finally, we show that the treatment methods only partially recover the performance losses. On average, typically, about 30 % or less of the performance that was lost due to class imbalance was recovered by these methods. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.","Class imbalance; Experimental setup; Sampling methods","Springer London"

Menzies suggested there is a ceiling effect of 80% Recall [8]. Most of the data sets used are highly imbalanced. This paper asks, what is the empirical effect of using different datasets with varying levels of imbalance on predictive performance? We use data synthesised by a previous meta-analysis of 600 fault prediction models and their results. Four model evaluation measures (the Mathews Correlation Coeficient (MCC), F-Measure, Precision and Re- call ) are compared to the corresponding data imbalance ratio. When the data are imbalanced, the predictive performance of software defect prediction studies is low. As the data become more balanced, the predictive performance of prediction models increases, from an average MCC of 0.15, until the minority class makes up 20% of the instances in the dataset, where the MCC reaches an average value of about 0.34. As the proportion of the minority class increases above 20%, the predictive performance does not significantly increase. Using datasets with more than 20% of the instances being defective has not had a significant impact on the predictive performance when using MCC. We conclude that comparing the results of defect prediction studies should take into account the imbalance of the data. © 2015 ACM.","Data Imbalance; Defect Prediction; Machine Learning","Association for Computing Machinery"

For common complexity scenes, existing crowd counting approaches are mainly based on regression models which learn a mapping between low-level features and class labels. One of the major challenges for generating a good regression function is the insufficient and imbalanced training data. Observationally, the problem of crowd counting has the characteristic that crowd images with adjacent class labels contain similar features, which can be utilized to reduce the effect of insufficiency and imbalance by the strategy of information reuse. Consequently, this paper introduces a label distribution learning (LDL) strategy into crowd counting, where crowd images are labelled with label distributions instead of the conventional single labels. In this way, one crowd instance can contribute to not only the learning of its real class label, but also the learning of neighboring class labels. Hence the training data are increased significantly, and the classes with insufficient training data are supplied with more training data, which belongs to their adjacent classes. Experimental results prove the effectiveness and robustness of the LDL method for crowd counting. We have also shown the outstanding performance of the approach in different dataset. © 2015 Elsevier B.V..","Crowd counting; Information reuse; Label distributions; Visual surveillance","Elsevier B.V."

In this study, our motivation is to investigate the effects of class noise on the classification performance of various learners using multiple derived datasets with varying degrees of data quality and class imbalance. Class imbalance is another challenging characteristic that occurs when one class has many more instances than the other class(es). To this end, we conducted experiments using a filter-based subset selection method applied to multiple derived datasets generated by injecting artificial class noise in a controlled manner creating three levels of data quality: High-Quality, Average-Quality, and Low-Quality. Our results along with statistical analysis show that Random Forest outperforms other learners without any exceptions for all levels of balance and data quality.

However, many traditional machine learning methods suffer from the imbalanced data which are also collected in online sequential manner. To get fast and efficient classification for this special problem, a new online sequential extreme learning machine method with sequential SMOTE strategy is proposed. The key idea of this method is to reduce the randomness while generating virtual minority samples by means of the distribution characteristic of online sequential data. Utilizing online-sequential extreme learning machine as baseline algorithm, this method contains two stages. In offline stage, principal curve is introduced to model the each class's distribution based on which some virtual samples are generated by synthetic minority over-sampling technique(SMOTE). In online stage, each class's membership is determined according to the projection distance of sample to principal curve. With the help of these memberships, the redundant majority samples as well as unreasonable virtual minority samples are all excluded to lighten the imbalance level in online stage.

Machine learning has been widely employed for handling this type of data predominantly applying two-class classification techniques. However, one-class approach has the ability to deal with imbalanced distribution and unexpected noise in the data. To deal with these situations it is considered that the best option is using the minority class as the target concept. This is reinforced by the idea of obtaining a classifier able to adjust itself to the specificity of the given class despite sacrificing the additional information about the second class. Although this consideration appears in different research, there are no thorough studies that prove it experimentally. In this paper, we investigate the suitability of employing minority class as the concept target in one-class classification to handle the class imbalance problem. A study over several microarray data sets is included. The results confirm that the use of minority class allows us to obtain better performance in one-class classification. © 2015 IEEE.","Adaptation models; Colon; Libraries; Programming; Prototypes; Training; Upper bound","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

The bugs contributing to the phenomenon of software aging are defined as Aging Related Bugs (ARBs). Lots of manpower and economic costs will be saved if ARBs can be found in the testing phase. However, due to the low presence probability and reproducing difficulty of ARBs, it is usually hard to predict ARBs within a project. In this paper, we study whether and how ARBs can be located through cross-project prediction. We propose a transfer learning based aging related bug prediction approach (TLAP), which takes advantage of transfer learning to reduce the distribution difference between training sets and testing sets while preserving their data variance. Furthermore, in order to mitigate the severe class imbalance, class imbalance learning is conducted on the transferred latent space. Finally, we employ machine learning methods to handle the bug prediction tasks. The effectiveness of our approach is validated and evaluated by experiments on two real software systems.

The purpose of a classification algorithm, also known as a 'classifier', is to identify what class, or category an observation belongs to. In many real-world scenarios, datasets tend to suffer from class imbalance, where the number of observations belonging to one class greatly outnumbers that of the observations belonging to other classes. Class imbalance has been shown to hinder the performance of classifiers, and several techniques have been developed to improve the performance of imbalanced classifiers. Using a cost matrix is one such technique for dealing with class imbalance, however it requires a matrix to be either pre-defined, or manually optimized. This paper proposes an approach for automatically generating optimized cost matrices using a genetic algorithm. The genetic algorithm can generate matrices for classification problems with any number of classes, and is easy to tailor towards specific use-cases. The proposed approach is compared against unoptimized classifiers and alternative cost matrix optimization techniques using a variety of datasets.

Computeraided diagnostic approaches based on thermography are typically split into a feature extraction stage that derives useful information from the thermogram images, and a classification stage that distinguishes between malignant and benign cases. The latter is challenging since, as is the case for many medical decision making problems, there are (many) more benign cases available for classifier training compared to malignant cases, leading to an imbalanced classification problem. In this paper, we first perform image analysis to identify features describing bilateral differences in regions of interest in the thermogram. These features then form the input for a pattern classification stage for which we present several strategies to address the existing class imbalance in the context of ensemble classifiers. In particular, we discuss an ensemble constructed of cost-sensitive decision tree classifiers, an ensemble whose base classifiers are trained on balanced subspaces, and an ensemble that is based on the combination of one-class classifiers. All three strategies are evaluated on a challenging dataset of about 150 thermograms and it is shown that they provide very good classification performance and furthermore perform favourably compared to other state-of-the-art classifier ensembles for imbalanced data. © 2015 IEEE.","breast cancer; breast thermogram; ensemble classification; imbalanced classification; machine learning","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Some regulatory regions (e.g. enhancers) are located far away from the gene they affect. Identification of distal regulatory elements is a challenge for the bioinformatics research. Although existing methodologies increased the number of computationally predicted enhancers, performance inconsistency of computational models across different cell-lines, class imbalance within the learning sets and ad hoc rules for selecting enhancer candidates for supervised learning, are some key questions that require further examination. In this study we developed DEEP, a novel ensemble prediction framework. DEEP integrates three components with diverse characteristics that streamline the analysis of enhancer's properties in a great variety of cellular conditions. In our method we train many individual classification models that we combine to classify DNA regions as enhancers or non-enhancers. DEEP uses features derived from histone modification marks or attributes coming from sequence characteristics. Experimental results indicate that DEEP performs better than four state-of-the-art methods on the ENCODE data.

Surprisingly, one of the main challenges when using machine learning to build clinically useful risk models is the small amount of data available. Risk models need to be developed for specific patient populations, specific institutions, specific procedures, and specific outcomes. With each exclusion criterion, the amount of relevant training data decreases, until there is often an insufficient amount to learn an accurate model. This difficulty is compounded by the large class imbalance that is often present in medical applications. In this paper, we present an approach to address the problem of small data using transfer learning methods in the context of developing risk models for cardiac surgeries. We explore ways to build surgery-specific and hospital-specific models (the target task) using information from other kinds of surgeries and other hospitals (source tasks). We propose a novel method to weight examples based on their similarity to the target task training examples to take advantage of the useful examples while discounting less relevant ones. We show that incorporating appropriate source data in training can lead to improved performance over using only target task training data, and that our method of instance weighting can lead to further improvements. Applied to a surgical risk stratification task, our method, which used data from two institutions, performed comparably to the risk model published by the Society for Thoracic Surgeons, which was developed and tested on over one hundred thousand surgeries from hundreds of institutions. © 2015 ACM.","Instance weighting; Risk stratification models; Transfer learning","Association for Computing Machinery"

It minimizes the within class and between class imbalance by learning and sampling different distributions (Gaussian and Poisson) and reduces bias and variance in error by employing the MultiBoost ensemble.

Although existing knowledge discovery and data mining techniques have shown great success in many real-world applications, dynamic data has the features of imbalance and instability of data classes, the dynamic change of data volume, which makes it difficult for the classification of dynamic data. To solve these problems, in this paper a robust weighed online sequential extreme learning machine algorithm (RWOSELM) based on the online sequential extreme learning machine algorithm (OSELM) is presented. RWOSELM generates the local dynamic weighted matrix with the help of cost sensitive learning theory, thereby it optimizes the empirical risk of the classification model. Meanwhile, RWOSELM takes the data distribution changes which are caused by temporal properties change of dynamic data into consideration, thus it introduces the forgetting factor to enhance the sensitivity of the classifier to the change of data distribution. The method is able to deal with the data with imbalanced class distribution, and maintains the good robust on dynamic data.

This study introduces new ensemble margin criteria to evaluate the performance of Random Forests (RF) in the context of large area land cover classification and examines the effect of different training data characteristics (imbalance and mislabelling) on classification accuracy and uncertainty. The study presents a new margin weighted confusion matrix, which used in combination with the traditional confusion matrix, provides confidence estimates associated with correctly and misclassified instances in the RF classification model. Landsat TM satellite imagery, topographic and climate ancillary data are used to build binary (forest/non-forest) and multiclass (forest canopy cover classes) classification models, trained using sample aerial photograph maps, across Victoria, Australia. Experiments were undertaken to reveal insights into the behaviour of RF over large and complex data, in which training data are not evenly distributed among classes (imbalance) and contain systematically mislabelled instances. Results of experiments reveal that while the error rate of the RF classifier is relatively insensitive to mislabelled training data (in the multiclass experiment, overall 78.3% Kappa with no mislabelled instances to 70.1% with 25% mislabelling in each class), the level of associated confidence falls at a faster rate than overall accuracy with increasing amounts of mislabelled training data. In general, balanced training data resulted in the lowest overall error rates for classification experiments (82.3% and 78.3% for the binary and multiclass experiments respectively). However, results of the study demonstrate that imbalance can be introduced to improve error rates of more difficult classes, without adversely affecting overall classification accuracy. © 2015 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, Inc.

Standard classification methods do not provide accurate predictions in this setting since classification is generally biased towards the majority class. The minority classes are oftentimes the ones of interest (e.g., when they are associated with pathological conditions in patients), so methods for handling imbalanced datasets are critical.Using several different datasets, this paper evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art classification methods for handling the imbalance problem in both binary and multi-class datasets. Different strategies are considered, including the one-class and dimension reduction approaches, as well as their fusions. Moreover, some ensembles of classifiers are tested, in addition to stand-alone classifiers, to assess the effectiveness of ensembles in the presence of imbalance. Finally, a novel ensemble of ensembles is designed specifically to tackle the problem of class imbalance: the proposed ensemble does not need to be tuned separately for each dataset and outperforms all the other tested approaches.To validate our classifiers we resort to the KEEL-dataset repository, whose data partitions (training/test) are publicly available and have already been used in the open literature: as a consequence, it is possible to report a fair comparison among different approaches in the literature.Our best approach (MATLAB code and datasets not easily accessible elsewhere) © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Downsampling/oversampling; Ensemble of classifiers; Imbalanced dataset; Support vector machine","Elsevier B.V."

When this variable is nominal, we have a problem of class imbalance that was thoroughly studied within machine learning. For regression tasks, where the target variable is continuous, few works exist addressing this type of problem. Still, important applications involve forecasting rare extreme values of a continuous target variable. This paper describes a contribution to this type of tasks. Namely, we propose to address such tasks by resampling approaches that change the distribution of the given data set to decrease the problem of imbalance between the rare target cases and the most frequent ones. We present two modifications of well-known resampling strategies for classification tasks: the under-sampling and the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) methods. These modifications allow the use of these strategies on regression tasks where the goal is to forecast rare extreme values of the target variable. In an extensive set of experiments, we provide empirical evidence for the superiority of our proposals for these particular regression tasks.

The main problems of existing methods are: (1) The degree of re-sampling, a key factor greatly affecting performance, needs to be pre-fixed, which is difficult to make the optimal choice; (2) Many useful negative samples are discarded in under-sampling; (3) The effectiveness of algorithm-level methods are limited because they just use the original training data for single classifier. To address the above issues, a novel approach of adaptive sampling with optimal cost is proposed for class-imbalance learning in this paper. The novelty of the proposed approach mainly lies in: adaptively over-sampling the minority positive examples and under-sampling the majority negative examples, forming different sub-classifiers by different subsets of training data with the best cost ratio adaptively chosen, and combining these sub-classifiers according to their accuracy to create a strong classifier. It aims to make full use of the whole training data and improve the performance of classimbalance learning classifier. The solid experiments are conducted to compare the performance between the proposed approach and 12 state-of-the-art methods on challenging 16 UC1 data sets on 3 evaluation metrics, and the results show the proposed approach can achieve superior performance in class-imbalance learning.

The λ here is a factor for regularization over all the training patterns. By the regulator λ the optimization weights all the training patterns uniquely with an equivalent cost despite there are different altitudes among the training samples. The altitudes may vary with the difference in sampling cost, the different uncertainties behind the samples, or even the imbalance between the adversary classes. Models capable of assigning various costs for individual samples are hence developed in this paper. By passing the regularization to Remp[f] term, this study proposes different regularization models of the support vector machines by tuning a parameterized governing loss function. Since the loss function is a key for success of the support vector machines, changing the loss function individually extends the support vector machines capable of accomplishing the missions mentioned above.

In fact, the underlying protein classification problem is a huge multiclass problem. Generally, the multiclass problem can be reduced to a set of binary classification problems. The protein in one class are seen as positive examples while those outside the class are seen as negative examples. However, the class imbalance problem will arise in this case because the number of protein in one class is usually much smaller than that of the protein outside the class. To handle the challenge, we propose a novel framework to classify the protein. We firstly use free scores (FS) to perform feature extraction for protein; then, the inverse random under sampling (IRUS) is used to create a large number of distinct training sets; next, we use a new ensemble approach to combine these distinct training sets with a new fuzzy total margin support vector machine (FTM-SVM) that we have constructed. we call the novel ensemble classifier as ensemble fuzzy total margin support vector machine (EnFTM-SVM). We then give a full description of our method, including the details of its derivation.

Current imbalanced learning methods often handle this problem by adapting certain intermediate parameters so as to impose a bias on the minority data. However, most of these methods are in rigorous and need to adapt those factors via the trial-and-error procedure. Recently, a new model called Biased Minimax Probability Machine (BMPM) presents a rigorous and systematic work and has demonstrated very promising performance on imbalance learning. Despite its success, BMPM exclusively relies on global information, namely, the first order and second order data information; such information might be however unreliable, especially for the minority data. In this paper, we propose a new model called One-Side Probability Machine (OSPM). Different from the previous approaches, OSPM can lead to rigorous treatment on biased classification tasks. Importantly, the proposed OSPM exploits the reliable global information from one side only, i.e., the majority class, while engaging the robust local learning from the other side, i.e., the minority class. To our best knowledge, OSPM presents the first model capable of learning data both locally and globally. Our proposed model has also established close connections with various famous models such as BMPM, Support Vector Machine, and Maxi-Min Margin Machine. One appealing feature is that the optimization problem involved in the novel OSPM model can be cast as a convex second order conic programming problem with the global optimum guaranteed. A series of experimental results on three data sets demonstrate the advantages of our proposed methods over four competitive approaches. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Classification; Imbalanced learning; Learning locally and globally","Kluwer Academic Publishers"

Thus, new tools are required in order to adequately monitor and further diagnose anomalies that other segments of the DSL network cannot identify due to the pragmatic issues raised by hardware or software misconfigurations. In this work we present a fundamentally new approach for classifying known DSL-level anomalies by exploiting the properties of novelty detection via the employment of one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs). By virtue of the imbalance residing in the training samples that consequently lead to problematic prediction outcomes when used within two-class formulations, we adopt the properties of one-class classification and construct models for independently identifying and classifying a single type of a DSL-level anomaly. Given the fact that the greater number of the installed Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) within the DSL network of a large European ISP were misconfigured, thus unable to accurately flag anomalous events, we utilize as inference solutions the models derived by the one-class SVM formulations built by the known labels as flagged by the much smaller number of correctly configured DSLAMs in the same network in order to aid the classification aspect against the monitored unlabeled events. By reaching an average over 95% on a number of classification accuracy metrics such as precision, recall and F-score we show that one-class SVM classifiers overcome the biased classification outcomes achieved by the traditional two-class formulations and that they may constitute as viable and promising components within the design of future network fault management strategies. In addition, we demonstrate their superiority over commonly used two-class machine learning approaches such as Decision Trees and Bayesian Networks that has been used in the same context within past solutions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

So, a new variant of ELM called Weighted Extreme Learning Machine was developed. This technique aimed at handling imbalance data by assigning more weight to minority class and less weight to majority class. The limitation of this technique lied in that it generates weight according to class distribution of training data, thereby, creating dependency on input data.

The testing phase should be operated effectively in order to release bug-free software to end users. In the last two decades, academicians have taken an increasing interest in the software defect prediction problem, several machine learning techniques have been applied for more robust prediction. A different classification approach for this problem is proposed in this paper. A combination of traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the novel Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm are used in this study. Training the neural network is performed by ABC algorithm in order to find optimal weights. The False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) multiplied by parametric cost coefficients are the optimization task of the ABC algorithm. Software defect data in nature have a class imbalance because of the skewed distribution of defective and non-defective modules, so that conventional error functions of the neural network produce unbalanced FPR and FNR results. The proposed approach was applied to five publicly available datasets from the NASA Metrics Data Program repository. Accuracy, probability of detection, probability of false alarm, balance, Area Under Curve (AUC), and Normalized Expected Cost of Misclassification (NECM) are the main performance indicators of our classification approach. In order to prevent random results, the dataset was shuffled and the algorithm was executed 10 times with the use of n-fold cross-validation in each iteration.

Other more sophisticated representations of text based on syntactic, semantic and argumentative properties have been less studied. In this paper, we evaluate the impact of different text representations of biomedical texts as features for reproducing the MeSH annotations of some of the most frequent MeSH headings. In addition to unigrams and bigrams, these features include noun phrases, citation meta-data, citation structure, and semantic annotation of the citations. Results: Traditional features like unigrams and bigrams exhibit strong performance compared to other feature sets. Little or no improvement is obtained when using meta-data or citation structure. Noun phrases are too sparse and thus have lower performance compared to more traditional features. Conceptual annotation of the texts by MetaMap shows similar performance compared to unigrams, but adding concepts from the UMLS taxonomy does not improve the performance of using only mapped concepts. The combination of all the features performs largely better than any individual feature set considered. In addition, this combination improves the performance of a state-of-the-art MeSH indexer. Concerning the machine learning algorithms, we find that those that are more resilient to class imbalance largely obtain better performance. Conclusions: We conclude that even though traditional features such as unigrams and bigrams have strong performance compared to other features, it is possible to combine them to effectively improve the performance of the bag-of-words representation. We have also found that the combination of the learning algorithm and feature sets has an influence in the overall performance of the system. Moreover, using learning algorithms resilient to class imbalance largely improves performance. However, when using a large set of features, consideration needs to be taken with algorithms due to the risk of over-fitting. Specific combinations of learning algorithms and features for individual MeSH headings could further increase the performance of an indexing system. © Jimeno Yepes et al.; licensee BioMed Central.","Biomedical literature; Feature engineering; MeSH indexing; Text categorization","BioMed Central Ltd."

The purpose of this paper is to study whether possible sources of error are not only the imbalance but also other factors in combination, which lead to these misclassifications. The theoretical difficulties in purely predictive settings arise from the lack of visualization. Therefore, for kernel classifiers we propose the link with a kernel version of multidimensional scaling in high-dimensional feature space. The transformed version of the features specifically discloses the intrinsic structure of Hilbert space and is then used as inputs into a learning system: in the example, this prediction method is based on the SVMs-rebalance methodology. The graphical representations indicate the effects of masking, skewed, and multimodal distribution, which are also responsible for the poor performance. By studying the properties of the misclassifications, we can further develop ways to improve them. © 2014, The Natural Computing Applications Forum.","Class imbalance problem; Graphical representations; Multidimensional scaling; Sources of error; SVMs-rebalance","Springer London"

Box 35247, Amman, 11180, Jordan","Feature selection from imbalance data plays an important role in building efficient support decision systems, improving the machine learning process performance and enhancing the classification accuracy. The problem of feature selection becomes even more difficult with imbalance data, which occurs in real-world domains when the classes representing the data set are not equally distributed. Using the traditional classifiers to seek an accurate performance over a full range of instances is not suitable to deal with imbalanced learning tasks, since they tend to classify all the data into one class. In this paper, the Mahalanobis genetic algorithm (MGA) classifier is proposed to address the problem of feature selection for imbalance welding data. The MGA classifier was benchmarked with the Mahalanobis-Taguchi system (MTS) classifier, in terms of the following metrics: the total misclassification errors, the area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio. A real-life data set from the spot welding process was used as a pilot study. The results in terms of the total misclassification error and the AUC metrics showed that the MGA had better classification performance than MTS. Very close results were obtained when the training data set was balanced by using the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) which indicates the suitability of the MGA and MTS classifiers to be used for the imbalance data set without using any preprocessor approach. Regarding the S/N ratio, the results were inconsistent with the other classification metrics, which raises the question about its credibility. © 2014, Springer-Verlag London.","Feature selection; Imbalance data; Mahalanobis genetic algorithm; Mahalanobis-Taguchi system; SMOTE; Welding","Springer London"

Firstly, the standard deviation of samples projection to normal vector for SVM classifier hyper plane is analyzed. The imbalance feature expression reflecting the hyper plane shift for the number imbalance between samples and the dispersion imbalance within samples is derived. At the same time, the denoising factor is designed as the exponential decay function based on the Euclidean distance between each sample and the class center. Secondly, the imbalance feature expression and denoising factor are configured into the membership function. Each sample has its own weight denoted the importance to the classifier.

It is also hard to ensure balanced distribution between data pertaining to defective and non-defective software. In most experimental cases, data related to the latter software class is dominantly present in the dataset. Objective: The objectives of this paper are to demonstrate the positive effects of combining feature selection and ensemble learning on the performance of defect classification. Along with efficient feature selection, a new two-variant (with and without feature selection) ensemble learning algorithm is proposed to provide robustness to both data imbalance and feature redundancy. Method: We carefully combine selected ensemble learning models with efficient feature selection to address these issues and mitigate their effects on the defect classification performance. Results: Forward selection showed that only few features contribute to high area under the receiver-operating curve (AUC). On the tested datasets, greedy forward selection (GFS) method outperformed other feature selection techniques such as Pearson's correlation. This suggests that features are highly unstable. However, ensemble learners like random forests and the proposed algorithm, average probability ensemble (APE), are not as affected by poor features as in the case of weighted support vector machines (W-SVMs). Moreover, the APE model combined with greedy forward selection (enhanced APE) achieved AUC values of approximately 1.0 for the NASA datasets: PC2, PC4, and MC1. Conclusion: This paper shows that features of a software dataset must be carefully selected for accurate classification of defective components. Furthermore, tackling the software data issues, mentioned above, with the proposed combined learning model resulted in remarkable classification performance paving the way for successful quality control. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Digital soil mapping (DSM) can quantitatively predict the spatial distribution of soil taxonomic classes. Key components of DSM are the method and the set of environmental covariates used to predict soil classes. Machine learning is a general term for a broad set of statistical modeling techniques. Many different machine learning models have been applied in the literature and there are different approaches for selecting covariates for DSM. However, there is little guidance as to which, if any, machine learning model and covariate set might be optimal for predicting soil classes across different landscapes. Our objective was to compare multiple machine learning models and covariate sets for predicting soil taxonomic classes at three geographically distinct areas in the semi-arid western United States of America (southern New Mexico, southwestern Utah, and northeastern Wyoming). All three areas were the focus of digital soil mapping studies. Sampling sites at each study area were selected using conditioned Latin hypercube sampling (cLHS). We compared models that had been used in other DSM studies, including clustering algorithms, discriminant analysis, multinomial logistic regression, neural networks, tree based methods, and support vector machine classifiers. Tested machine learning models were divided into three groups based on model complexity: simple, moderate, and complex. We also compared environmental covariates derived from digital elevation models and Landsat imagery that were divided into three different sets: 1) covariates selected a priori by soil scientists familiar with each area and used as input into cLHS, 2) the covariates in set 1 plus 113 additional covariates, and 3) covariates selected using recursive feature elimination.Overall, complex models were consistently more accurate than simple or moderately complex models. Random forests (RF) using covariates selected via recursive feature elimination was consistently the most accurate, or was among the most accurate, classifiers between study areas and between covariate sets within each study area. We recommend that for soil taxonomic class prediction, complex models and covariates selected by recursive feature elimination be used.Overall classification accuracy in each study area was largely dependent upon the number of soil taxonomic classes and the frequency distribution of pedon observations between taxonomic classes. Individual subgroup class accuracy was generally dependent upon the number of soil pedon observations in each taxonomic class. The number of soil classes is related to the inherent variability of a given area. The imbalance of soil pedon observations between classes is likely related to cLHS. Imbalanced frequency distributions of soil pedon observations between classes must be addressed to improve model accuracy. Solutions include increasing the number of soil pedon observations in classes with few observations or decreasing the number of classes. Spatial predictions using the most accurate models generally agree with expected soil-landscape relationships. Spatial prediction uncertainty was lowest in areas of relatively low relief for each study area. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Brier score; Digital soil mapping; Machine learning; Random forests; Recursive feature elimination","Elsevier"

Classifiers learned on public health data were not predictive of retinopathy.DISCUSSION: Successful approaches to detecting latent retinopathy using machine learning could help safety net and other clinics identify unscreened patients who are most at risk of developing retinopathy and the use of ensemble classifiers on clinical data shows promise for this purpose.",,

However, in many cases one of the classes is dominant in comparison with others. Here, the classifier will become biased towards the majority class. This scenario is known as imbalanced classification. As the minority class is usually the one more valuable, we need to counter the imbalance effect by using one of several dedicated techniques. Cost-sensitive methods assume a penalty factor for misclassifying the minority objects. This way, by assuming a higher cost to minority objects we boost their importance for the classification process. In this paper, we propose a model of cost-sensitive neural network with moving threshold. It relies on scaling the output of the classifier with a given cost function. This way, we adjust our support functions towards the minority class. We propose a novel method for automatically determining the cost, based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. It allows us to select the most efficient cost factor for a given dataset.

Such imbalance severely reduces bag-of-poses based classification performance. On the other hand, collecting a dataset of human gestures or actions is an expensive and time-consuming procedure. It is often impractical to reacquire the data or to modify the existing dataset using oversampling or undersampling procedures. The best way to handle such imbalance is by making the used classifier be directly aware and adapt to the real condition inside the data. Balancing class distribution, i.e., the number of pose samples per class, is one of difficult tasks in machine learning. Standard statistical learning models (e.g., SVM, HMM, CRF) are insensitive to unbalanced datasets. This paper proposes a distribution-sensitive prior on a standard statistical learning, i.e., Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), to deal with the imbalanced data problem. This prior analyzes the training dataset before learning a model. Thus, the RVM can put more weight on the samples from under-represented classes, while allows overall samples from the dataset to have a balanced impact to the learning process. Our experiment uses a publicly available gesture datasets, the Microsoft Research Cambridge-12 (MSRC-12). Experimental results show the importance of adapting to the unbalanced data and improving the recognition performance through distribution-sensitive prior. © 2015 The Authors.","Distribution-Sensitive Learning; human gesture recognition; Relevance Vector Machine","Elsevier B.V."

Early diagnosis of AD is essential for the progress of more prevailing treatments. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence, employs a variety of probabilistic and optimization techniques that permits PCs to gain from vast and complex datasets. As a result, researchers focus on using machine learning frequently for diagnosis of early stages of AD. This paper presents a review, analysis and critical evaluation of the recent work done for the early detection of AD using ML techniques. Several methods achieved promising prediction accuracies, however they were evaluated on different pathologically unproven data sets from different imaging modalities making it difficult to make a fair comparison among them. Moreover, many other factors such as pre-processing, the number of important attributes for feature selection, class imbalance distinctively affect the assessment of the prediction accuracy. To overcome these limitations, a model is proposed which comprise of initial pre-processing step followed by imperative attributes selection and classification is achieved using association rule mining. Furthermore, this proposed model based approach gives the right direction for research in early diagnosis of AD and has the potential to distinguish AD from healthy controls. © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Alzheimer's disease; Class imbalance; Computer aided diagnosis; Early diagnosis; Machine learning; Pathologically proven data","SciTePress"

Specifically, the two-class problem has received interest from researchers in recent years, leading to solutions for oil spill detection, tumour discovery and fraudulent credit card detection, amongst others. However, handling class imbalance in datasets that contains multiple classes, with varying degree of imbalance, has received limited attention. In such a multi-class imbalanced dataset, the classification model tends to favour the majority classes and incorrectly classify instances from the minority classes as belonging to the majority classes, leading to poor predictive accuracies. Further, there is a need to handle both the imbalances between classes as well as address the selection of examples within a class (i.e. the so-called within class imbalance). In this paper, we propose the SCUT hybrid sampling method, which is used to balance the number of training examples in such a multi-class setting. Our SCUT approach oversamples minority class examples through the generation of synthetic examples and employs cluster analysis in order to undersample majority classes. In addition, it handles both within-class and between-class imbalance. Our experimental results against a number of multi-class problems show that, when the SCUT method is used for pre-processing the data before classification, we obtain highly accurate models that compare favourably to the state-of-the-art. © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Classification; Clustering; Multi-class imbalance; Oversampling; Undersampling","SciTePress"

The design of effective strategies able to face this problem is however particularly challenging, due to several factors, such as the heterogeneity and the non-stationary distribution of the data stream, as well as the presence of an imbalanced class distribution. To complicate the problem, there is the scarcity of public datasets for confidentiality issues, which does not allow researchers to verify the new strategies in many data contexts. Differently from the canonical stateof- the-art strategies, instead of defining a unique model based on the past transactions of the users, we follow a Divide and Conquer strategy, by defining multiple models (user behavioral patterns), which we exploit to evaluate a new transaction, in order to detect potential attempts of fraud. We can act on some parameters of this process, in order to adapt the models sensitivity to the operating environment. Considering that our models do not need to be trained with both the past legitimate and fraudulent transactions of a user, since they use only the legitimate ones, we can operate in a proactive manner, by detecting fraudulent transactions that have never occurred in the past. Such a way to proceed also overcomes the data imbalance problem that afflicts the machine learning approaches. The evaluation of the proposed approach is performed by comparing it with one of the most performant approaches at the state of the art as Random Forests, using a real-world credit card. © 2015 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.","Fraud detection; Pattern recognition; User model","SciTePress"

This class skew problem can cause difficulties in both estimating a model and selecting a decision boundary. Since the publication of King & Zeng’s studies in 2001, scholars have utilized case-control methods to address this issue. This article builds on the landmark research of the Political Instability Task Force comparing the case-control approach to several other methods from the machine learning field and some original to this study. Case-control methods have several practical disadvantages and show no measurable advantages in prediction. The article also introduces cost-sensitive methods for determining a decision boundary. This explication raises questions about the Task Force’s formulation of a decision boundary and suggests methods for making useful predictions for policy. I find that the decision boundary chosen by the PITF implicitly assumes that the cost of intervention is about 7.7% of the cost of non-intervention when state failure will take place. These findings demonstrate that there is still much work to be done in predicting state failure, especially in limiting the number of false positives. More generally, it suggests caution in using accuracy as a measure of success when significant class imbalance exists in the data. © The Author(s) 2015.","Case-Control studies; Class skew; Cost-Sensitive learning; Political forecasting; Rare events; State failure","SAGE Publications Ltd"

In these problems, the empirical error is uninformative about the performance of the classifier and the loss functions usually produce models that are shifted to the majority class.

In this approach, we proposed two term evaluation functions called as PNF and PNF2 which can produce more influential weights by relying on the imbalanced data sets. These functions can determine the significance of a term in association with a particular category. This is a crucial point because in one hand a frequent term is more important than a rare term in a particular category according to feature selection approach, and on the other hand a rare term is no less important than a frequent term based on idf assumption of traditional term weighting approach.

Through a series of iterations, the information of all the positive and negative samples is completely exploited. In each iteration, a new classification instance is trained by the equal number of positive and negative samples. In this way, the negative effect of class imbalance is efficiently relieved. The new instance primarily focuses on those samples that are easy to be misclassified. In addition, the positive samples are assigned higher cost weight than the negative samples.

To fill the gap, in this paper, we present a general structural SVM framework for directly optimizing AM and QM.

The Consolidated Tree Construction (CTC) algorithm was proposed as an algorithm to solve a classification problem involving a high degree of class imbalance without losing the explaining capacity, a desirable characteristic of single decision trees and rule sets. CTC works by resampling the training sample and building a tree from each subsample, in a similar manner to ensemble classifiers, but applying the ensemble process during the tree construction phase, resulting in a unique final tree. In the ECML/PKDD 2013 conference the term ""Inner Ensembles"" was coined to refer to such methodologies. In this paper we propose a resampling strategy for classification algorithms that use multiple subsamples. This strategy is based on the class distribution of the training sample to ensure a minimum representation of all classes when resampling. This strategy has been applied to CTC over different classification contexts. A robust classification algorithm should not just be able to rank in the top positions for certain classification problems but should be able to excel when faced with a broad range of problems.

Many machine learning based classification models were designed and are still getting improved to solve the problem of defect prediction. The effectiveness of these models is influenced mainly by two key quality of data factors – set of software metrics used to build the models and proportion of defect-prone instances in the software measurement data set. In this paper, we proposed a classification model which is a combination of Naive Bayes and relational association rules. The classifier discovers relational association rules on the metrics data based on user defined confidence and support during training stage and integrates using Naive Bayes at testing stage to predict whether a software module is defective or non defective. An experimental evaluation of the proposed model is carried out on open source bug prediction dataset containing object oriented metrics. The proposed model performed better with class imbalance data and is compared with existing machine learning based techniques – Naive Bayes, Bagging and One R. The results obtained are positive having better improvement than existing mainly for the evaluation measures – Recall and F-Measure. The proposed model has shown high True positive rate of defective modules which signifies the model capability of identifying defective modules as defective than any other classifiers used in the experiment.

In this paper we propose a cost-sensitive classification technique called CSForest which is an ensemble of decision trees. We also propose a cost-sensitive voting technique called CSVoting in order to take advantage of the set of decision trees in minimizing the classification cost.

First, we review known extensions and compare them in a comprehensive experimental study. The results show that integrating bagging with under-sampling is more powerful than over-sampling. They also allow to distinguish Roughly Balanced Bagging as the most accurate extension. Then, we point out that complex and difficult distribution of the minority class can be handled by analyzing the content of a neighbourhood of examples. In our study we show that taking into account such local characteristics of the minority class distribution can be useful both for analyzing performance of ensembles with respect to data difficulty factors and for proposing new generalizations of bagging. We demonstrate it by proposing Neighbourhood Balanced Bagging, where sampling probabilities of examples are modified according to the class distribution in their neighbourhood. Two of its versions are considered: the first one keeping a larger size of bootstrap samples by hybrid over-sampling and the other reducing this size with stronger under-sampling. Experiments prove that the first version is significantly better than existing over-sampling bagging extensions while the other version is competitive to Roughly Balanced Bagging.

HCCI engine operation is constrained by combustion instabilities, such as knock, ringing, misfires, high-variability combustion, and so on, and it becomes important to identify the operating envelope defined by these constraints for use in engine diagnostics and controller design. HCCI combustion is dominated by complex nonlinear dynamics, and a first-principle-based dynamic modeling of the operating envelope becomes intractable. In this paper, a machine learning approach is presented to identify the stable operating envelope of HCCI combustion, by learning directly from the experimental data. Stability is defined using thresholds on combustion features obtained from engine in-cylinder pressure measurements. This paper considers instabilities arising from engine misfire and high-variability combustion. A gasoline HCCI engine is used for generating stable and unstable data observations. Owing to an imbalance in class proportions in the data set, the models are developed both based on resampling the data set (by undersampling and oversampling) and based on a cost-sensitive learning method (by overweighting the minority class relative to the majority class observations). Support vector machines (SVMs) and recently developed extreme learning machines (ELM) are utilized for developing dynamic classifiers. The results compared against linear classification methods show that cost-sensitive nonlinear ELM and SVM classification algorithms are well suited for the problem. However, the SVM envelope model requires about 80% more parameters for an accuracy improvement of 3% compared with the ELM envelope model indicating that ELM models may be computationally suitable for the engine application. The proposed modeling approach shows that HCCI engine misfires and high-variability combustion can be predicted ahead of time, given the present values of available sensor measurements, making the models suitable for engine diagnostics and control applications. © 2012 IEEE.","Class imbalance learning; dynamic classification; engine control; engine diagnostics; extreme learning machine; homogeneous charge compression ignition; misfire prediction; operating envelope model; support vector machine; system identification.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Existing oversampling approaches for addressing this problem typically do not consider the probability distribution of the minority class while synthetically generating new samples. As a result, the minority class is not represented well which leads to high misclassification error. We introduce two probabilistic oversampling approaches, namely RACOG and wRACOG, to synthetically generating and strategically selecting new minority class samples. The proposed approaches use the joint probability distribution of data attributes and Gibbs sampling to generate new minority class samples. While RACOG selects samples produced by the Gibbs sampler based on a predefined lag, wRACOG selects those samples that have the highest probability of being misclassified by the existing learning model. We validate our approach using nine UCI data sets that were carefully modified to exhibit class imbalance and one new application domain data set with inherent extreme class imbalance. In addition, we compare the classification performance of the proposed methods with three other existing resampling techniques. © 2014 IEEE.","Approximating joint probability distribution; Gibbs sampling; Imbalanced class distribution; Probabilistic oversampling","IEEE Computer Society"

Successful identification of candidate drug targets in entire genomes is very useful, and computational prediction methods can speed up this process. In the current work we have developed a sequence-based prediction method for the successful identification and discrimination of human drug target proteins, from human non-drug target proteins. The training features include sequence-based features, such as amino acid composition, amino acid property group composition, and dipeptide composition for generating predictive models. The classification of human drug target proteins presents a classic example of class imbalance. We have addressed this issue by using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) as a preprocessing step, for balancing the training data with a ratio of 1:1 between drug targets (minority samples) and non-drug targets (majority samples). Using ensemble classification learning method-Rotation Forest and ReliefF feature-selection technique for selecting the optimal subset of salient features, the best model with selected features can achieve 87.1% sensitivity, 83.6% specificity, and 85.3% accuracy, with 0.71 Matthews correlation coefficient (mcc) on a tenfold stratified cross-validation test. The subset of identified optimal features may help in assessing the compositional patterns in human drug targets. For further validation, using a rigorous leave-one-out cross-validation test, the model achieved 88.1% sensitivity, 83.0% specificity, 85.5% accuracy, and 0.712 mcc. The proposed method was tested on a second dataset, for which the current pipeline gave promising results.

In such cases, when the number of labeled instances is overwhelmed by the number of unlabeled instances, semi-supervised learning represents a cost-effective alternative that can improve supervised classifiers by utilizing unlabeled data. In practice, data oftentimes exhibits imbalanced class distributions, which represents an obstacle for both supervised and semi-supervised learning.

In this paper, under-sampling, synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE), cost-sensitive learning and ensemble learning are introduced and compared for hypernetwork to make it be able to tackle the class imbalance problems appropriately.

Without dataset rebalancing, the learning algorithm will encounter extremely low minority class samples therefore it gets biased towards the majority class in the classification tasks. Hence properly handling the imbalanced dataset is a crucial issue in the pattern recognition domain. We have employed bootstrapping by simultaneous oversampling of the minority class and under sampling of the majority class to build the ensemble of classifiers. Oversampling is partially guided by the extracted hidden patterns from minority class, which prevents its over-generalization and amplify subtle vital patterns.

This paper develops a two-step approach to evolving ensembles using genetic programming (GP) for unbalanced data. The first step uses multiobjective (MO) GP to evolve a Pareto-approximated front of GP classifiers to form the ensemble by trading-off the minority and the majority class against each other during learning. The MO component alleviates the reliance on sampling to artificially rebalance the data. The second step, which is the focus this paper, proposes a novel ensemble selection approach using GP to automatically find/choose the best individuals for the ensemble. This new GP approach combines multiple Pareto-approximated front members into a single composite genetic program solution to represent the (optimized) ensemble. This ensemble representation has two main advantages/novelties over traditional genetic algorithm (GA) approaches. First, by limiting the depth of the composite solution trees, we use selection pressure during evolution to find small highly-cooperative groups of individuals for the ensemble. This means that ensemble sizes are not fixed a priori (as in GA), but vary depending on the strength of the base learners. Second, we compare different function set operators in the composite solution trees to explore new ways to aggregate the member outputs and thus, control how the ensemble computes its output. We show that the proposed GP approach evolves smaller more diverse ensembles compared to an established ensemble selection algorithm, while still performing as well as, or better than the established approach. The evolved GP ensembles also perform well compared to other bagging and boosting approaches, particularly on tasks with high levels of class imbalance. © 1997-2012 IEEE.","Classification; ensemble machine learning; genetic programming; unbalanced data","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

By exploiting the fact that close-by time points are highly correlated due to smoothness of the time-series, our model significantly reduces the number of covariance parameters to be estimated from O(d2) to O(Ld), where L is the number of mixture components and d is the dimensionality. Thus, our model is particularly effective for modeling high-dimensional time-series with limited number of instances in the minority positive class. In addition, the computational complexity for learning the model is only of the order O(Ln+d2) where n+ is the number of positively labeled samples. We conduct extensive classification experiments based on several well-known time-series data sets (both single- and multimodal) by first randomly generating synthetic instances from our learned mixture model to correct the imbalance. We then compare our results with several state-of-the-art oversampling techniques and the results demonstrate that when our proposed model is used in oversampling, the same support vector machines classifier achieves much better classification accuracy across the range of data sets. In fact, the proposed method achieves the best average performance 30 times out of 36 multimodal data sets according to the F-value metric.

The main difference between them is that a CFL approach seeks optimal classification results without requiring any cost information, even in the class imbalance problem. In fact, several CFL approaches exist in the related studies, such as sampling and some criteria-based approaches. However, to our best knowledge, none of the existing CFL and CSL approaches are able to process the abstaining classifications properly when no information is given about errors and rejects. Based on information theory, we propose a novel CFL which seeks to maximize normalized mutual information of the targets and the decision outputs of classifiers. Using the strategy, we can handle binary/multi-class classifications with/without abstaining. Significant features are observed from the new strategy. While the degree of class imbalance is changing, the proposed strategy is able to balance the errors and rejects accordingly and automatically. Another advantage of the strategy is its ability of deriving optimal rejection thresholds for abstaining classifications and the 'equivalent' costs in binary classifications. The connection between rejection thresholds and ROC curve is explored. Empirical investigation is made on several benchmark data sets in comparison with other existing approaches. The classification results demonstrate a promising perspective of the strategy in machine learning. © 1989-2012 IEEE.","abstaining; class imbalance; Classification; cost-free learning; cost-sensitive learning; mutual information; ROC","IEEE Computer Society"

Therefore, in terms of data, balance or imbalance, should not be simply interpreted as the ratio of the overall number of two class instances, but should be interpreted as the ratio close to the boundary. © 2014 IEEE.","borderline ratio based sampling; imbalanced data; support vector machine","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Recently a representation learning technique called Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) has been proposed to handle imbalanced data problem. Random Forest (RF) algorithm with SMOTE has been previously used to improve classification performance in minority class over majority class. Although RF with SMOTE demonstrates improved classification performance, the relationship between the classification performance and the imbalanced ratio between the majority and minority classes is not well defined. Therefore mathematical models that describe this relationship is useful especially in the big data environment which suffers from imbalanced data. In this paper, we proposed a mathematical model using an empirical approach applied to the well known Spambase dataset and Random Forest classification approach including its adoption with SMOTE representation learning technique. We have presented a linear model which describes the relationship between true positive classification rate and the imbalanced ratio between the majority and minority classes.

The increased uncertainty and typically asymmetric costs surrounding rare events increase this need. Experts (and classification systems) often rely on probabilities to inform decisions. However, we demonstrate that class probability estimates obtained via supervised learning in imbalanced scenarios systematically underestimate the probabilities for minority class instances, despite ostensibly good overall calibration. To our knowledge, this problem has not previously been explored. We propose a new metric, the stratified Brier score, to capture class-specific calibration, analogous to the per-class metrics widely used to assess the discriminative performance of classifiers in imbalanced scenarios. We propose a simple, effective method to mitigate the bias of probability estimates for imbalanced data that bags estimators independently calibrated over balanced bootstrap samples. This approach drastically improves performance on the minority instances without greatly affecting overall calibration. We extend our previous work in this direction by providing ample additional empirical evidence for the utility of this strategy, using both support vector machines and boosted decision trees as base learners. Finally, we show that additional uncertainty can be exploited via a Bayesian approach by considering posterior distributions over bagged probability estimates. © 2013, Springer-Verlag London.","Boosted decision-trees; Brier-score; Calibration; Classification; Imbalance; Platt; SVM; Unbalance","Springer London"

Accurately identifying interaction residues solely from protein sequences is useful for both protein function annotation and drug design, especially in the post-genomic era, as large volumes of protein data have not been functionally annotated. Protein-nucleotide binding residue prediction is a typical imbalanced learning problem, where binding residues are extremely fewer in number than non-binding residues. Alleviating the severity of class imbalance has been demonstrated to be a promising means of improving the prediction performance of a machine-learning-based predictor for class imbalance problems. However, little attention has been paid to the negative impact of class imbalance on protein-nucleotide binding residue prediction.

The experimental results from protein-nucleotide interaction datasets demonstrate that the proposed supervised over-sampling algorithm can relieve the severity of class imbalance and help to improve prediction performance.

The new system uses a destructive approach that starts with large-sized rules and gradually decreases the sizes as evolution progresses. Unlike most previous works, EDARIC adopts an intelligent deletion mechanism, evolves a separate population for each class of a given problem and uses an ensemble system to classify unknown instances. These features help in avoiding over-fitting and class-imbalance problems, which are beneficial for improving generalization ability of a classification system. EDARIC also applies a rule post-processing step to exempt the evolution phase from the burden of tuning a large number of parameters.

This technique is known as binarization. The decision boundary that these binary classifiers (also called base classifiers) have to learn is much simpler than the decision boundary of a multiclass classifier. But binarization gives rise to a new problem called the class imbalance problem. Class imbalance problem occurs when the data set used for training has relatively less data items for one class than for another class. This problem becomes more severe if the original data set itself was imbalanced. Furthermore, binarization has only been implemented in the domain of supervised classification. In this paper, we propose a framework called Binarization with Boosting and Oversampling (BBO). Our framework can handle the class imbalance problem arising from binarization. As the name of the framework suggests, this is achieved through a combination of boosting and oversampling. BBO framework can be used with any supervised classification algorithm. Moreover, unlike any other binarization approaches used earlier, we apply our framework with semi-supervised classification as well. BBO framework has been rigorously tested with a number of benchmark data sets from UCI machine learning repository.

Time-series event prediction consists of two steps: (i) feature extraction, and (ii) prediction.

The quality of sensor data is indicated by discrete quality flags that indicate the level of uncertainty associated with a sensor reading. Depending on the domain and the problem under consideration, the level of uncertainty is different and thus unsupervised methods like outlier detection fails to match the expectation. The quality flags are normally assigned by domain experts. Considering the volume of sensor data, manual assignment is a laborious task and subject to human error. Given a representative set of labelled data, a supervised classification approach is thus a feasible alternative. The nature of sensor data, however, poses some challenges to the classification task. Data of dubious quality exists in such data sets with very small frequency leading to the class imbalance problem. We thus adopt a cluster oriented sampling approach to address the imbalance issue. In addition, it is beneficial to train multiple classifiers to improve the overall classification accuracy. We thus produce multiple under-sampled training sets using cluster oriented sampling and train base classifiers on each of them. Decisions produced by the base classifiers are fused into a single decision using majority voting. We have evaluated the proposed ensemble classification framework by assessing the quality of marine sensor data obtained from sensors situated at Sullivans Cove, Hobart, Australia. Experimental results reveal that the proposed framework agrees with expert judgement with high accuracy and achieves superior classification performance than other state-of-the-art approaches. © 2013 IEEE.","class balancing; ensemble classifier; quality assessment of sensor data; Sensors; time series classification",

However, the PM10 prediction model often suffers from data imbalance problem in the training dataset that results in failure to forecast the minority class of severe cases. In this study, a warning system using extreme learning machine (ELM), compared with support vector machine (SVM), was constructed to forecast the class of PM10 level: Good, Moderate, and Severe. An imbalance strategy called prior duplication was also applied to improve the forecast of minority class. The experimental comparisons between ELM and SVM demonstrate that ELM produces superior accuracy relative to SVM in forecasting minority class (Severe) of PM10 level with or without the imbalance strategy. Furthermore, our results show that the required training time and model size in the ELM model are much shorter and smaller than those of SVM respectively, leading to a more efficient and practical implementation of prediction model for large dataset.

Previous studies on class-imbalance learning mainly focused on relatively small or moderate class-imbalance. In this paper we conduct an empirical study to explore the difference between learning with small or moderate class-imbalance and learning with severe class-imbalance. The experimental results show that: (1) Traditional methods cannot handle severe class-imbalance effectively. (2) AUC, G-mean and F-measure can be very inconsistent for severe class-imbalance, which seldom appears when class-imbalance is moderate. And G-mean is not appropriate for severe class-imbalance learning because it is not sensitive to the change of imbalance ratio. (3) When AUC and G-mean are evaluation metrics, EasyEnsemble is the best method, followed by BalanceCascade and under-sampling. (4) A little under-full balance is better for under-sampling to handle severe class-imbalance.

Traditional sampling approaches generally rely on random resampling from a given dataset. However, these approaches do not take into consideration additional information, such as sample quality and usefulness. We recently proposed a data sampling technique, called sample subset optimization (SSO). The SSO technique relies on a cross-validation procedure for identifying and selecting the most useful samples as subsets. In this paper, we describe the application of SSO techniques to imbalanced and ensemble learning problems, respectively. For imbalanced learning, the SSO technique is employed as an under-sampling technique for identifying a subset of highly discriminative samples in the majority class. In ensemble learning, the SSO technique is utilized as a generic ensemble technique where multiple optimized subsets of samples from each class are selected for building an ensemble classifier. We demonstrate the utilities and advantages of the proposed techniques on a variety of bioinformatics applications where class imbalance, small sample size, and noisy data are prevalent. © 2013 IEEE.","Bioinformatics applications; ensemble learning; imbalanced learning; sample subset optimization (SSO); under-sampling",

It is likely to result in biased classification results. In this paper, a two-phase classification framework is proposed to make the classification of imbalanced data more accurate and stable. The proposed framework is based on the correlations generated between concepts. The general idea is to identify negative data instances which have certain positive correlations with data instances in the target concept to facilitate the classification task.

To improve the significance of the rare and specific region belonging to the minority class in the decision region, we take the SVM as a pre-processor to balance the training dataset and use multiple feature selection combination grounded on ensemble learning in order to determine the most representative features from the re-sized dataset. The representative features are then fed into the BPNN ensemble to construct an effective financial pre-warning mechanism. Lacking comprehensibility and readability is one of the fatal weaknesses of an ensemble classifier and it impedes its real-life application. Thus, the study executes RST to extract knowledge from the BPNN ensemble for decision makers to make suitable judgments. Decision makers can take the decision rules as a roadmap to modify a firm's capital structure so as to survive in an extremely turbulent financial market.

As a consequence, training data are often imbalanced, presenting an heavily skewed distribution of labels. Using conventional classification techniques produces biased results, as the classifier may easily show a very good performance on the over-represented class and a very poor performance on the under-represented class: the former dominates the learning process and tends to attract all predictions. Furthermore, the classical accuracy measure is misleading, as it assumes equal importance for the true positives and the true negatives. We propose a classification procedure based on Support Vector Machine able to effectively cope with data imbalance. Using a first step approximate solution and then a suitable kernel transformation, we enlarge asymmetrically space around the class boundary, compensating data skewness. We also propose an accuracy measure, named AGF, that properly accounts for the different misclassification costs of the two classes.

Research also established that class imbalance is not an issue by itself, but its relationship with class overlapping and noise has an important impact on the prediction performance and stability. This fact has motivated the development of several approaches for classification of imbalanced data (see e.g. [29,39]). In this paper, we present credit card customer churn prediction, an important topic in business analytics, using an ensemble of classifiers. Since this problem is considered as highly imbalanced, we employ different techniques for classification, such as Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and two-class SVMs. The main idea is to address both class imbalance and class overlapping by stacking different classification approaches, while evaluating the diversity of the individual classifiers considering meta-learning measures. We performed experiments on artificial data sets and one real customer churn prediction problem from a Chilean financial entity, comparing our approach with well-known classification techniques for imbalanced data. The proposed strategy achieves an improvement of 6.1% over the best individual classifier in terms of predictive performance, providing accurate and robust classification models for different levels of balance and noise. © 2014-IOS Press.","churn prediction; Classification; ensemble learning; imbalanced data; meta learning; support vector data description; support vector machines",

Recently, few high-throughput techniques (e.g. protein microarray screen, phage display) have been applied to determine in-vitro binding specificity of PDZ domains. Currently, many computational methods are available to predict PDZ-peptide interactions but they often provide domain specific models and/or have a limited domain coverage. Results: Here, we composed the largest set of PDZ domains derived from human, mouse, fly and worm proteomes and defined binding models for PDZ domain families to improve the domain coverage and prediction specificity. For that purpose, we first identified a novel set of 138 PDZ families, comprising of 548 PDZ domains from aforementioned organisms, based on efficient clustering according to their sequence identity. For 43 PDZ families, covering 226 PDZ domains with available interaction data, we built specialized models using a support vector machine approach. The advantage of family-wise models is that they can also be used to determine the binding specificity of a newly characterized PDZ domain with sufficient sequence identity to the known families. Since most current experimental approaches provide only positive data, we have to cope with the class imbalance problem. Thus, to enrich the negative class, we introduced a powerful semi-supervised technique to generate high confidence non-interaction data. We report competitive predictive performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches. Conclusions: Our approach has several contributions. First, we show that domain coverage can be increased by applying accurate clustering technique. Second, we developed an approach based on a semi-supervised strategy to get high confidence negative data. Third, we allowed high order correlations between the amino acid positions in the binding peptides. Fourth, our method is general enough and will easily be applicable to other peptide recognition modules such as SH2 domains and finally, we performed a genome-wide prediction for 101 human and 102 mouse PDZ domains and uncovered novel interactions with biological relevance. We make all the predictive models and genome-wide predictions freely available to the scientific community. © 2014 Kundu and Backofen.",,"BioMed Central Ltd."

In our work we are applying machine learning methods to longitudinal records of MS patients to build a classifier that predicts whether a patient will have a significant increase in disability at the five year mark using information from the first two years of clinical visits. This prediction is key for choosing among the available treatments as some have more troubling side-effect profiles. Two challenges arise while learning with this data. First, patient data involves the physician's (possibly subjective) evaluation. Because a patient's data may come from one doctor on the first visit and different doctors on subsequent visits, it can be difficult to form an accurate predictor of disease outcome. In particular, some physicians may be biased in one direction, scoring each patient as more severe than would other physicians, while others may be biased in the opposite direction. Another challenge is that it is much easier to classify the cases with low future disability compared to cases with high future disability at early stages of the disease. This asymmetric property is due to the nature of the disease rather than class imbalance. In this paper we introduce a new transfer learning approach to handle these challenges. The algorithm builds a single SVM classifier for each doctor by dividing the entire dataset into primary (instances from the doctor) and auxiliary (instances from other doctors) sets. When applied to our dataset of MS patients our new approach is able to realize a significant increase in prediction performance over approaches that form a single SVM classifier for the entire dataset or for the physician's dataset alone.

To address this issue, this paper presents a novel class augmentation technique, which enhances each class's representation which initially consists of only limited set of labelled examples. Our augmentation employs a connectivity-based influence computation algorithm with an incorporated decaying mechanism for the unlabelled samples. Besides augmentation, our method also introduces structure preserving oversampling to correct class imbalance.

For this purpose, we applied genetic algorithm to search for an optimal weight vector on which classifier ensemble is expected to give the best accuracy. The proposed approach is evaluated on variety of real life datasets. It is also compared with existing standard ensemble techniques such as Adaboost, Bagging, and Random Subspace Methods. Experimental results show the superiority of proposed ensemble method as compared to its competitors, especially in the presence of class label noise and imbalance classes. © 2014 Shehzad Khalid et al.",,"Hindawi Limited"

This study investigates two different kinds of feature selection metrics (one-sided and two-sided) as a global component of term weighting schemes (called as tffs) in scenarios where different complexities and imbalance ratios are available. Traditional term weighting approach (tfidf) is employed as a base line to evaluate the effects of tffs weighting. In fact, this study aims to present which kind of weighting schemes are suitable for which machine learning algorithms on different imbalanced cases. Four classification algorithms are used to indicate the effects of term weighting schemes on the imbalanced datasets. According to our findings, regardless of tfidf, term weighting methods based on one-sided feature selection metrics are better approaches for SVM and k-NN algorithms while two-sided based term weighting methods are the best choice for MultiNB and C4.5 on the imbalanced texts. As a result, the use of term weighting methods based on one-sided feature selection metrics is recommended for SVM and tfidf is suitable weighting method for k-NN algorithm in text classification tasks.

A newly developed physical-inspired classification method, i.e., the data gravitation-based classification (DGC) model, performs well in many general classification problems. However, like other general classifiers, the performance of DGC suffers in imbalanced tasks. In this study, we develop a specific DGC model namely Imbalanced DGC (IDGC) model for imbalanced problems. The amplified gravitation coefficient (AGC) is introduced for gravitation computing. AGC is a type of coefficient that contains class imbalance information, which can strengthen and weaken the gravitational field of the minority and majority classes. We also design a fitness evaluation function in the weight optimization procedure of the data distribution to ensure that the model parameters adapt to the imbalanced class distributions.

If diagnosed early, it can be easily cured, and consequently early diagnosis of melanoma is of vital importance. In this paper, we present an effective approach to melanoma classification from dermoscopy images of skin lesions. First, we perform automatic border detection to delineate the lesion from the background skin. We then extract shape features from the border, while colour and texture features are obtained based on a division of the image into clinically significant regions using a Euclidean distance transform. The derived features are then used in a pattern classification stage for which we employ a dedicated ensemble learning approach to address the class imbalance in the training data. In particular, we employ a committee of one-class classifiers for that purpose. One-class classification uses samples from a single distribution to derive a decision boundary, and employing this method on the minority class can significantly boost its recognition rate and hence the sensitivity of our approach. We combine several one-class classifiers using a random subspace approach and a diversity measure to select members of the committee.

Search-By-Multiple-Examples (SBME), a promising method for overcoming this problem, allows users to specify their information needs as a set of relevant documents rather than as a set of keywords. Most of the studies on SBME adopt the Positive Unlabeled learning (PU learning) techniques by treating the users' provided examples (denote as query examples) as positive set and the entire data collection as unlabeled set. However, it is inefficient to treat the entire data collection as unlabeled set, as its size can be huge. In addition, the query examples are treated as being relevant to a single topic, but it is often the case that they can be relevant to multiple topics. As the query examples are much fewer than the unlabeled data, the system performance may downgrade dramatically because of the class imbalance problem. What's more, the experiments conducted in these studies have not taken into account the settings in online search, which are very different from the controlled experiments scenario. This proposed research seeks to explore how to improve SBME by exploring: (1) how to predict user' information needs by modeling the content of the documents using probabilistic topic models; (2) how to deal with the class imbalance problem by reducing the size of the unlabeled data and adopting machine learning techniques. We will also conduct extensive experiments to better evaluate SBME using different sizes of query examples to simulate users' information needs. © 2014 Authors.","information retrieval; positive unlabeled learning; search by multiple examples; transductive inference","Association for Computing Machinery"

However, it is generally expensive to acquire labeled data, while unlabeled data is available in much larger amounts. A cost-effective alternative is to use Semi-Supervised Learning, which uses unlabeled data to improve supervised classifiers. Furthermore, for many practical problems, data often exhibits imbalanced class distributions and learning becomes more challenging for both supervised and semisupervised learning scenarios. While the problem of supervised learning from imbalanced data has been extensively studied, it has not been studied much for semi-supervised learning. Thus, in this study, we carry out an empirical evaluation of a semi-supervised learning algorithm, specifically self-training based on Näive Bayes Multinomial (NBM), and address the issue of imbalanced class distributions both at data-level (by re-sampling) and algorithmic-level (using cost-sensitive learning and ensembles). We conduct our study on the problem of splice site prediction, a problem for which the ratio of positive to negative examples is very high.

RF has shown great success in many real-world applications. However, the problem of learning from text data with class imbalance is a relatively new challenge that needs to be addressed. A RF algorithm tends to use a simple random sampling of features in building their decision trees. As a result, it selects many subspaces that contain few, if any, informative features for the minority class. Furthermore, the Gini measure for data splitting is considered to be skew sensitive and bias towards the majority class. Due to the inherent complex characteristics of imbalanced text datasets, learning RF from such data requires new approaches to overcome challenges related to feature subspace selection and cut-point choice while performing node splitting. To this end, we propose a new tree induction method that selects splits, both feature subspace selection and splitting criterion, for RF on imbalanced text data. The key idea is to stratify features into two groups and to generate effective term weighting for the features. One group contains positive features for the minority class and the other one contains the negative features for the majority class. Then, for feature subspace selection, we effectively select features from each group based on the term weights. The advantage of our approach is that each subspace contains adequate informative features for both minority and majority classes. One difference between our proposed tree induction method and the classical RF method is that our method uses Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier to split the training data into smaller and more balance subsets at each tree node, and then successively retrains the SVM classifiers on the data partitions to refine the model while moving down the tree. In this way, we force the classifiers to learn from refined feature subspaces and data subsets to fit the imbalanced data better. Hence, the tree model becomes more robust for text categorization task with imbalanced dataset. Experimental results on various benchmark imbalanced text datasets (Reuters-21578, Ohsumed, and imbalanced 20 newsgroup) consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ForesTexter method. The performance of our proposed approach is competitive against the standard random forest and different variants of SVM algorithms. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

We prove, that despite the multi-class nature of hyperspectral images using one-class approach can be beneficial.

One-class classifiers can handle difficulties embedded in the nature of the hyperspectral data, such as a large number of classes, class imbalance and noisy pixels. For this task, we utilise our novel ensemble, based on soft clustering of the object space. On the basis of each cluster, a weighted one-class classifier is constructed.

In recent years, because the traditional classifier algorithms are designed only for balanced cases, these classifiers always achieved poor performance in imbalanced data classification issues, especially for the imbalanced data with a really high density. This paper introduces the importance of imbalanced data classification in various fields first; then, contends existing methods of solving the imbalanced data classification problem; finally, proposes two new sampling methods, which are based on borderline-SMOTE, for the imbalanced data with high density, especially for big data with this kind of distribution feature. These two new algorithms are not only over-sampling the minority samples near the borderline, but also creating appropriate synthetic samples in the majority class samples side and under-sampling some particular majority class samples. Experiments show that these two algorithms could achieve a better performance than random over sampling, SMOTE (Synthetic minority over-sampling technique) and Borderline-SMOTE in AUC (Area under Receiver Operating Characteristics Curve) metric evaluate method, when the sampling rate makes the majority class and minority class samples approximate equilibrium. © 2014 IEEE.","big data; classification; high density; imbalanced data; sampling method","IEEE Computer Society"

We tested our method using Id3, C4.5, Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes and Random Forest as machine learning algorithms for correct spelling prediction.

We present a novel adaptive oversampling algorithm, Virtual, that combines the benefits of oversampling and active learning. Unlike traditional resampling methods which require preprocessing of the data, Virtual generates synthetic examples for the minority class during the training process, therefore it removes the need for an extra preprocessing stage. In the context of learning with Support Vector Machines, we demonstrate that Virtual outperforms competitive oversampling techniques both in terms of generalization performance and computational complexity. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.",,"Springer Verlag"

It is a powerful tool to improve the accuracy of classifiers. This approach has become increasingly interesting, especially for real-world problems, which are often characterized by their imbalanced nature. The unbalanced distribution of data leads to poor performance of most of the conventional machine learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel weighted rough set as a Meta classifier framework for 14 classifiers to find the smallest and optimal ensemble, which maximize the overall ensemble accuracy. We propose a new entropy-based method to compute the weight of each classifier. Each classifier assigns a weight based on its contribution to classification accuracy. Thanks to the powerful reduct technique in rough set, this guarantees high diversity of the produced reduct ensembles. The higher diversity between the core classifiers has a positive impact on the performance of minority class as well as on the overall system performance. Experimental results with ozone dataset demonstrate the advantages of weighted rough set Meta classifier framework over the well-known Meta classifiers like Bagging, boosting and random forest as well as any individual classifiers.","Class imbalance learning; Entropy; Real world web service; Weighted rough set","Budapest Tech Polytechnical Institution"

The existing class imbalance learning methods can make Support Vector Machines (SVMs) less sensitive to class imbalance; they still suffer from the disturbance of outliers and noise present in the datasets. A kind of Fuzzy Smooth Support Vector Machines (FSSVMs) are proposed based on the Smooth Support Vector Machine (SSVM) of O. L. Mangasarian. SSVM can be computed by the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm or the Newton-Armijo algorithm easily. Two kinds of fuzzy memberships and three smooth functions can be chosen in the algorithms. The fuzzy memberships consider the contribution rate of each sample to the optimal separating hyperplane. The polynomial smooth functions can make the optimization problem more accurate at the inflection point. Those changes play the active effects on trials. The results of the experiments show that the FSSVMs can gain the better accuracy and the shorter time than the SSVMs and some of the other methods. © 2014 Chuandong Qin and Huixia Zhao.",,"Hindawi Publishing Corporation"

After the 2011 historic milestone of defeating the two best human players in the Jeopardy! game show, the technology behind IBM Watson, DeepQA, is undergoing gamification into real-world business problems. Gamifying a business domain for Watson is a composite of functional, content, and training adaptation for nongame play. During domain gamification for medical, financial, government, or any other business, each system change affects the machine-learning process. As opposed to the original Watson Jeopardy!, whose class distribution of positive-to-negative labels is 1:100, in adaptation the computed training instances, question-and-answer pairs transformed into true-false labels, result in a very low positive-to-negative ratio of 1:100 000. Such initial extreme class imbalance during domain gamification poses a big challenge for the Watson machine-learning pipelines. The combination of ingested corpus sets, question-and-answer pairs, configuration settings, and NLP algorithms contribute toward the challenging data state. We propose several data engineering techniques, such as answer key vetting and expansion, source ingestion, oversampling classes, and question set modifications to increase the computed true labels. In addition, algorithm engineering, such as an implementation of the Newton-Raphson logistic regression with a regularization term, relaxes the constraints of class imbalance during training adaptation. We conclude by empirically demonstrating that data and algorithm engineering are complementary and indispensable to overcome the challenges in this first Watson gamification for real-world business problems. © 2009-2012 IEEE.","Gamification; machine learning; natural language processing (NLP); pattern recognition","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."

Utrera km. 1, 41013 Sevilla, Spain","Credit risk models are commonly based on large internal data sets to produce reliable estimates of the probability of default (PD) that should be validated with time. However, in the real world, a substantial portion of the exposures is included in low-default portfolios (LDPs) in which the number of defaulted loans is usually much lower than the number of non-default observations. Modelling of these imbalanced data sets is particularly problematic with small portfolios in which the absence of information increases the specification error. Sovereigns, banks, or specialised retail exposures are recent examples of post-crisis portfolios with insufficient data for PD estimates, which require specific tools for risk quantification and validation. This paper explores the suitability of cooperative strategies for managing such scarce LDPs. In addition to the use of statistical and machine-learning classifiers, this paper explores the suitability of cooperative models and bootstrapping strategies for default prediction and multi-grade PD setting using two real-world credit consumer data sets. The performance is assessed in terms of out-of-sample and out-of-time discriminatory power, PD calibration, and stability. The results indicate that combinational approaches based on correlation-adjusted strategies are promising techniques for managing sparse LDPs and providing accurate and well-calibrated credit risk estimates. © 2014 Operational Research Society Ltd.

In this paper, three new operating point selection strategies based on receiver operating characteristic curve are proposed to address the problem. Methods: Classification on imbalanced data performs inferiorly because of a major reason that the best differentiation threshold shifts due to the degree of data imbalance. To address this decision threshold shifting issue, three operating point selection strategies, i.e., shortest distance, harmonic mean and anti-harmonic mean, are proposed and their performances are investigated. Results: Experiments were conducted on a class-imbalanced database, which contains 64 polyps in 786 polyp candidates. Support vector machine (SVM) and random forests (RFs) were employed as basic classifiers. Two imbalanced data correcting techniques, i.e., cost-sensitive learning and training data down sampling, were applied to SVM and RFs, and their performances were compared with the proposed strategies. Comparing to the original thresholding method, i.e., 0.488 sensitivity and 0.986 specificity for RFs and 0.526 sensitivity and 0.977 specificity for SVM, our strategies achieved more balanced results, which are around 0.89 sensitivity and 0.92 specificity for RFs and 0.88 sensitivity and 0.90 specificity for SVM. Meanwhile, their performance remained at the same level regardless of whether other correcting methods are used. Conclusions: Based on the above experiments, the gain of our proposed strategies is noticeable: the sensitivity improved from 0.5 to around 0.88 for RFs and 0.89 for SVM while remaining a relatively high level of specificity, i.e., 0.92 for RFs and 0.90 for SVM. The performance of our proposed strategies was adaptive and robust with different levels of imbalanced data. This indicates a feasible solution to the shifting problem for favorable sensitivity and specificity in CAD of polyps from imbalanced data. © 2013 CARS.","Computed tomography colonography (CTC); Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD); Harmonic mean; Random forests; Receiver operating characteristic (ROC); Support vector machine (SVM)","Springer Verlag"
